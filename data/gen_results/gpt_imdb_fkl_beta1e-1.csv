"If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl","If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl! If this film is to be made into any kind of movie then you never know what type of acting it will be. And to top it all off it must be amazing! The movie has a strong story where they are forced to live with the idea of a group of bad guys that want revenge on themselves when they do die! In my opinion a good story is made of this. I will not spoil the acting here, but let's take the action section! Pierce, with any luck, will change the way you think about the world and your characters and then create a believable story. At the end of the day the film will make you love it! But if you don't LOVE the Black and White version, watch it and say ""This movie sucked!!!"", and that's enough! My rating=8/10, by the other reviewers and other people (thank you for the comments). I only want to say that I really enjoyed it as I am a huge fan of Poe but loved the character of Emily Grey. Emily is definitely a solid actress with good eye sight, great performance and beautiful facial expression, the scene in the bar scene made me go out of my way to watch for a moment of suspense. But it never gets old as most movies do not"
"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards, in order to continue living a life of luxury and fame. The film is about Jean-Paul Renaud's relationship with his daughter, Leopold. That was part of why he was so ambitious in this film, to the point where we begin to understand why, despite having lived a more complicated and complex life, we can see such a contrast at every turn. This leads to a complex and moving story with a strong cast which includes an unusual character, one who is a writer, a painter, an actress(Alessandro Del Palma), and a famous actor - which all work together in a very clever way. In short, Jean is the film that you cannot begin, with your hopes and dreams, your dreams with all your money, dreams you want to keep and your ambitions with everything else you are working on, and yet with nothing really happening to you that is anything near the real things that matter most to your entire life.<br /><br />The relationship between this great film and French society. It is quite obvious that Renault is also a great admirer of modern art-making in the country, especially art and film being one of his primary passions. So much so, that it is not strange that the first time we see it,"
Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made,"Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. It is extremely complex, a gripping drama which is truly a masterpiece and an exceptionally beautiful film which will leave you with a deep memory and unforgettable memories. This film is absolutely the best film that the world could have conceived without becoming the absolute best of cinema.<br /><br />The production values are the least of which need to be mentioned with great depth. From what most reviewers have said about the script, the direction, acting, script and screenplay the film has it all. We have plenty of great characters, we just know their strengths, weaknesses and weaknesses as well as their weaknesses, strengths and shortcomings are reflected throughout the story. A story which demands to see these individuals in a different way than the characters who exist only for themselves. Every character has a unique identity, many relationships within their own country, but they all come together in their respective ways. One character of mine recently told me that he never gets involved in politics, preferring to live on the streets of New York rather than in this country. I am absolutely convinced that all this and more is why Mr. Deane has managed to get to this great point where life is possible without a fixed point in his life. How many other films have had such a film called ""No Man's Land""?<br"
"I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE","I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE AND PEDOPHILE. This film is so wrong, it was actually more shocking then seeing it now, and I hate that a great filmmaker had such a positive impact on the lives of many young people. It took a special place in my heart, making me cry at the whole thing. With all the actors that I had seen in the film I am sad to say that they were totally wasted!! It is sad that some filmmakers can portray so much of this kind of nonsense. I think it is very shameful if they could not make a film that is as touching, uplifting and honest about what this movie was like! <br /><br />This movie is just like a dream to me. After reading my other comments my friends and family had already made up their mind to be the filmmakers to go with. Unfortunately, because of how I felt, our dream came true for these two amazing people, Babes and Pedophi leeked to their destiny! I was very fortunate to do the interviews with them, even though I could have done without the help of such amazing individuals that made this dream happen! If this ""film"" has your family on your minds...you should see it for yourself! The truth is...we do not have"

This only serves to add to the bad acting and weak writing throughout this first one,why can't this writer/director get all the points to get the film out?<- Pbq)"
This is a really fun movie,"This is a really fun movie for anyone who enjoys a good romance/romance story and a couple of bad romance movies. I love the storyline, the characters, and the great music. If you like cheesy teen romances, you'll love this movie but beware. Even though a fairly obscure British gangster/gangster movie, like this one, it's worth the watch or just sit through it and forget about it.<br /><br />You know, just because something doesn't work does not mean it is necessarily evil...in a funny way or something is. But, even though the plot was nice and had a nice atmosphere and atmosphere to it that made the movie fun for everyone.<BR /></br/>There was also some really cool music especially by the likes of Steve Buscemi, who plays the lead role. The music was catchy and was very original. And while it has to be said that it was really funny, I was a little bit surprised that the film wasn't so silly and ridiculous. So yeah it just makes me really recommend this to people that hate kids movies, or guys who like some ""teeny girl"" stuff. Overall, though, at least a lot of fun. For me, my rating of 7/10, definitely a plus.<Br /"

She has a problem, not realizing that at the same time she is responsible for the actions she has to take. And she does, even though she knows she will be ostracized...she's afraid to go public or face criticism, and when all else fails, she goes after him to tell him the truth!

"When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure","When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure in film making. The movie would fail miserably, with a handful of good actors in all but two of his early scenes. Unfortunately, his talent was severely misdirected and his work was a fiasco. Here is the truth about ""The Great Escape."" Here it's the baddie Robert Blake and a bunch of other poor souls. He's actually a decent character but he's a bad guy not in a good way.<br /><br />Blake has a very annoying voice too. In fact, the only time I heard a word that could be called ""unrealistic"" or ""apparantly fake"" was when he was in the desert with his own family when Blake's character was attacked. This made the movie sound like a true horror film but a lot of it is nonsense in this movie. It's just the same old old plot that goes nowhere near the intensity that came with the original ""Return of the King."" In truth, Blake never became this kind of baddies. If he did, I expect him to be ""better"" than a human being like James Earl Jones or Billy Crystal. His character is much more human than he is in ""Empire."" Blake is an ""artificial"" killer who can't make a difference whatsoever. You can"
"Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions)","Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions) for two reasons: it does not take itself seriously; and it has little to draw comparisons with the other recent films: the acting is all of the best (and in my opinion the funniest) in the film--and the sets are quite striking. (I would certainly recommend checking out the Polish film ""Dances in Dizzy's New York"", as it may be one of those films that was not made by Garb) The film is shot in a beautiful setting, with some lovely scenery to spare in these days, but not for every day audience. It is full of charm--both the characters and the camera."

At the end of the week, some men find themselves standing on it waiting for their husbands to have the whiskey and they begin to feel a bit better about themselves and their love-life. The first time I caught this after being hooked after reading all the wonderful interviews with people from the drag scene, I thought that this film was very entertaining and very powerful. It is actually one of my all time favorites."

"If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie","If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie of the late 20th century it's not.<br /><br />There are lots of plot holes, not just one. Most of my favorites, even these, are not plot issues and there's no such thing as real suspense at all. On the whole i felt the movie sucked, from how the police set up their crimes to which the main character, Mr. Pease, was responsible for setting up a plot to be used to manipulate the government into keeping him in prison. It's all so predictable, predictable and extremely predictable.<Br /></br>< br />The story isn`t that great and i wouldn`T blame anyone for that, but it`ll be a disappointment at the lowest possible bar or worse, the level of incompetence in the production.<BR /"

It's just that there is a point of view I find unsatisfying. You can easily guess what I mean... that of course isn't all that easy... but since it has just gotten started, as opposed to the rest of the series, that is what it's going to be. I'd just like to point out that, though I don't think the producers are going away, given the fact that this is the second season of The Simpsons. The first season did have a strong season, and they went into the season with very much optimism. <br direct quote from Wikipedia"
"After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth","After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth: from the martial art of the samurai to the magical martial techniques on show on TV. The acting is excellent as the duo of Kazuo Mizutani and Ryohei Takahashi, and their roles are excellent, they are the perfect duo to play the role of a villain. It shows what Japan can achieve if they go into combat with the right mindset and are realistic enough. And the scenes that they did give are priceless and really makes you feel what it is like to be surrounded and surrounded by love and family. I have never seen anything like it! They are good guys (in one scene they appear together in a movie) and well-played. Even after all the other movie ""chosen fights"" and fighting styles that I saw in the film, this movie is really worth listening to. This is my absolute worst Martial Arts movie. If you are going to watch this film on a Sunday night just start with you watch the movies, then you won't miss anything much! My biggest negative rating is that there were too many martial artists there that were never given a chance to spar with, instead of one of them being seen to make good mistakes that caused major injuries in other participants. In other words this is just a bad movie, the good fight scenes"
"""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life ","""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life!!! I actually watched about 20 or so of them. I got this film on DVD in early August 1983. That would be my first VHS movie, and I've never seen a DVD except for the last film made in 1974 (Proud Citizen). It just has an American look to it. And even if the movie wasn't technically an original feature (which is technically possible), the sound track, music, effects, dialogue etc. are quite excellent. It looks great, has the special effects well integrated (I think). The music in the film is especially memorable in its melodic style, very very good overall. The film also has a few special features, most notably, a lot of footage featuring some lovely animals. Some of my favorite scenes are in this special film  the scene wherein the dog tries to get the cat (with her, I think) to run with it for dear life is absolutely unforgettable."
i loved this movie,"i loved this movie. I had to watch it again, after going through the motions to find the way that this would feel to me. This was not an extremely good movie for people who like to like the ""old school"" story because the plot is the same. The movie is so bad and the pacing is awful that it took me 45 minutes to figure it out. For the record, I am not a fan of the movie, because it didn't seem like it was going to be a great film in the mold of it's sequels. At its core, this film was just bad. From the beginning, he's pretty much in love with his partner and he doesn't mind being left alone to do everything that he feels like doing...in my view, it does make him feel a little more at ease, though.<br /><br />So where does this come in? Well, let me first state that the script is terrible. And I think that's right. In a movie like this, a good script should have a sense of pacing that is in-order for it to move its audience in all directions. After all, the writing is at least as good as the characters. Some scenes are just so well-drawn that they are hilarious. Other scenes or characters aren"

But, for me, it's hard to come up with a better excuse for the jokes than the first ten minutes of the film. A movie that should have been titled The Flocks of Babylon. The first 25 minutes is a must see.<Br >""I Am The Princess Of The Moon"" is one of those movies you're probably most aware of; it deals with the adventures of a princess, Tiana. It's pretty dark, but is incredibly beautiful, which makes for a film that is perfect for those dark days, as it depicts TIA herself in her final moments, all in black and white! In fact, by the end of that film, she is absolutely gorgeous, stunning, beautifully sexy and oh so smart! When I see the next set of music, I'm reminded of my teenage year. All my favorite songs are now on their way to me: ""You Should Live Your Life In Black And White!"" ""Sweetheart"", ""Beautiful Women"" and ""Don't Look Now at My Eyes Forever""! Oh the good"
"This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela","This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. The central character, a beautiful student, comes to a great understanding that the world is not ready and that everything is a threat. He and his friends are on a journey to make their dream come true; a road in which most everyone around them is on the same boat. This is based on one of my earliest childhood memories, when I played football for my dad and our older brother and we would go into school and make our own decisions as parents. There is nothing wrong with that. It is almost completely non-fiction in my opinion, but as I said when discussing the nature of reality, it is always a little different since we always have different perspectives. As an observer, I always keep in mind that our protagonists are all human beings, with their own particular beliefs and values. For me they are the 'heroes' who have put everything ahead of what they believed in to prevent another tragedy because of their convictions and desire: the fear the government imposes on their world and their families. And when we accept any change, we all know it will come. That is, unless we are willing to accept the consequences. Of course the people we represent (including the main characters) are also people at the ends of a circle: we become the protagonists' friends and"

Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen.<br /><br />One of these stories was the play Little Macbeth by the legendary James Arthur. This was one of his biggest productions and he did it with such accuracy. The play was perfect, the main character was superb and the dialogs were outstanding. I couldn't wait for this movie to come out in theaters, I've never seen so many animated movies with fantastic writing and directing. My favorite scene is the final scene when the princess falls down from the golden throne. All the way through, it felt like an eternity in this wonderful tale. <br/>< br />After this success on Broadway, George Osborne signed this magnificent film to release on DVD, with an exciting storyline, which I think anyone would agree greatly enhanced the enjoyment of Disney. George's filmography is full of great movies and they all go above and beyond everything Disney's been saying previously.<a href=""http://www.walteproductions.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" />I highly recommend you see this film, make sure to sit through this one and get your ears ringing for the wonderful characters portrayed in it."

The only mistake was the idea of seeing William Shakespeare playing the main characters; they were all familiar to me in the novel.<br /><br />My only other problems with Père (which I had also read about in The Odyssey, The Tempest, Hamlets, and so on) was that it was so slow. It is hard to understand how someone will think it will be long and I never looked back.<BR / GARY PERRY was superb even before I saw this video.

A very underrated role and one she proved to be very attractive to her role with the great ""Little Rose"" and Joan Crawford in ""Bare"". I'm happy that they all had the auditions they had to wait to see how well they would be recognized by the viewers. All told this film is a very good work of art and it has the ability to attract and entertain many.

I'd much rather see some B-movie (especially one from Universal) than sit through this tedious pile of nonsense.<br /><br />This film has some nice dialogue but lacks subtle dialogue and dialogue. The scenes are repetitive and the actors seem to enjoy doing that type of thing. There are some scenes where blood flow and gore is unnecessary but this hardly even comes close to the pace and pace alone. You don't even notice any kind of fighting.

This is a brilliant political satire,"This is a brilliant political satire. An unapologetically anti-establishment political party, ""The Nationalism"", that tries with an unconvincing amount of self-serving logic to make the voters ""foolhardy"". I have never been so disgusted by this sort of political nonsense. It's a shame we didn't get to see this film in a wide audience just so many years ago - as the best of the great political comedy and film. I mean the most recent examples are the recent Oscar nominee film ""Prisoners of Wooten"", in which the central character is sent to prison in the UK without any parole. This was a terrible depiction of a truly rotten society which is far worse than the modern social order or even the way people behave today. The idea that such a country could be so completely corrupt and corrupt on the surface is laughable. There is nothing positive in these films. At best it is sad as to some of its actions. If this is the case then the fact that the character of this cynical, self depraved person in this movie is an example of why we need to take his political views seriously, why it all seems so absurd and ridiculous - is just a bad comment on this political scene. Shame, shame on Hollywood."
You play as B,"You play as Babs and one day his wife has turned him inside out... and he's got more money than they (or I) want. Also one of my favorite scenes is when he sees a bunch of guys dressed up like a gangsta.... they have a ""kid with a gun"" he makes sure to shoot them. I love that scene but I just wanted to add my own piece of goodness.<br /><br />The only bad thing that this movie had. The whole plot was laughable and that was at the heart of it. There wasn't enough in the movie so I decided I won't spend my time watching this pointless f***. Why did I even bother watching the first 40 minutes, I'm an idiot.<br><Br /=br>My rating isn't so high because only 10 other people did. That doesn't mean you should give this film a three or a four. It is a damn good horror film and for a budget of $1.15, this is one movie that deserved to be seen more times, but it didn't."
This film caught me by surprise,"This film caught me by surprise and I just love the way it works here. Everything is great. I've also noticed that the main character's mother, who was really nice to say when I said I was in love when she said it, was completely gorgeous as always. The only real surprise about the movie is that everyone else in the audience didn't make that comment that made me so happy. One scene was when the sister is eating dinner in a diner and she looks at the screen and says ""How come you looked so nervous for dessert?"" I saw that scene and was laughing at her so much. When she does that it makes me feel as if the film is going nowhere. <br /><br />I really love that movie and it made my heart beat for me to see a lot more of it. This may not be a masterpiece for every lover/fan, but it is amazing. For even a beginner and for anyone who finds a movie like this entertaining, it just makes my life much easier! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z0R0Q4I"" - Previous review]"

I was so blown away about how much I loved it! What a huge blessing to finally have this film in the possession of a DVD player! The quality is great! I love that I got my hands on it and will enjoy it throughout my lifetime!

"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way as his first sequel). It's an effective and moving thriller where the characters become aware of the nature of their existence as human beings. The novel is a tribute to King and shows us that they were not just human, but human-like. ""Man in the Machine"" is very different from the original and contains a good few scenes but also a lot of moving themes. Kubrick was the first filmmaker to direct an original film and is widely regarded as one of his pioneers by critics. I think it's great that his other projects were successful and his vision has become the norm as a director. Another nice thing about ""My Man"" also comes from a very well-known film writer(Kushner). We now have excellent and diverse directors who are able to take this genre as far as making it even more interesting with a more compelling and intelligent story. This is also the film that gives a great reason why even horror films fall into that category. In ""Shattered"" Kubrick is able not to lose touch with his own film but he still manages to be able of making interesting interpretations of other films from his work. Even now though, though he hasn't fully achieved all the visual aspects yet, as time progresses, films like ""The Shining"" and ""Dead Silence"""
i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me,"i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me was right.<br /><br />As is, most of the film takes place in a big city with little to no transportation. However, I believe that there was plenty of time to live out and the scenery was nicely shot in such a way that if you had to walk up and over it you could take a look at it. Also, unlike some movies made in the '60's where the shot is a bit larger than it should be in order to achieve the shots where they need to work, this one was well shot, and had its moments.< br / >The acting was very decent. The story of a boy who has the help of an extremely attractive woman who gives him a good education was a pleasant surprise. <br/>< br />Overall, a must see!"
"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect","The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect from the whole series. It is really entertaining and does a wonderful job at conveying the main concepts through the eyes of people who have never been involved with the program. The show is highly entertaining but not the greatest show I can think of that I have seen recently."
This is what makes me proud to be British,"This is what makes me proud to be British and how we have a reputation that we deserve to live. We have always loved the British as friends and a neighbour. What does our new country have in common? A beautiful and beautiful British countryside, a vibrant and vibrant history and culture.<br /><br />But, unfortunately there is just no end to what some have described as the 'Belt of Britain', something which just makes the film so disturbing. There are so many characters including the late Reverend Peter O'Connor and many of his fellow Church members on the fringes that I do not understand why they are forced into the role with all the faults they have on both sides.<Br />I have not seen the movie and, however, as I am a lifelong British member of Church I have the privilege of watching it for myself. A lot of that is done for my own happiness and enjoyment because of the original concept of this film making the most of every single minute I can think of. However, I must note that Mr O's comments also describe the ""Bands"" as being part British (even though they actually exist or originated in the UK). As such, they do have many members in their church or Church or local community and the same people are not the least bit involved throughout the overall plot,"
"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today. <br /><br />The movie features a scene where the two astronauts watch the scene unfold in different sets and the film takes all the footage into consideration. We see the crew sitting around in an empty room with a chair, with the rest of them sitting on an observation deck in some of the cooler weather of Saturn's atmosphere. They are both in one of those cold rooms and are at the bottom of a gigantic lake. There's also a shot that takes the astronauts down and then back through a very thick layer of ice with ice embedded in it. (Or maybe they were just sitting there watching the movie with no water when that ice layer began melting and they just looked at each other.) From what we see they are wearing shorts and hats with long black stitched hair that have thin streaks that they never show on the pictures. On screen it looks like they probably took two hours or more to work on this, but it never got out of hand and never slowed down to a pace of no more than 60 frames every 30 seconds.<br/><span style=""font-size: medium; padding: 3px;"" title=""The Colombo Escape"" type=""text/html; font-family: Colormont; margin-top: 10px;font"
"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love and the social strife caused by it. By the time of the Civil War, this was in full bloom. The War and World War I were not confined to American movies - this genre of cinema became particularly fashionable as the war progressed, and as a result, the films which were presented in this medium were a phenomenon. This brings to more detail those in the audience the story of George T. Douglas, a famous character from the English Civil war. In his book, he tells the tale of his friend James Douglas and his brother William Douglas as they try to decide whether to join the army in order to enlist in a new one. They were sent to England in late 1861 which was then an independent country in what would become the United States with the creation of New England and other Great Lakes states. Then the next day they landed in Great Britain (England) under the pretence they were going to go to Washington for the War. William died and James was sent straight to the front line in his second attempt when he fell under suspicion from General George Washington with whom he was at war with. When Douglas was taken prisoner there he tried to persuade Washington that he wasn't as dangerous to his country as was proved to him and put the two men in jail. That's what happened"
Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism, this movie is a film of extreme brutality and brutality that is not confined to just the female. Its anti-woman sentiment is one of the strongest elements of any film I have ever seen, and I think if some American woman is to really become famous enough to be considered a feminist, she should be."
"The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious","The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious. Yes, this is a little of an early example in the cast of this flick, but it's definitely not the worst comedy I've seen in quite some time. Overall, just plain delightful.<br /><br />My Rating: 3.5"
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films. If you get this one, I would advise you avoid it. It looks like a real high school slasher, so even the cast was too dull to really enjoy. There wasn't a shred of intelligence, the plot was almost unbelievable, and it was obviously not made by the makers. What I found most disturbing, as far as the editing, was the way they tried to recreate some parts of it from other spooky movies. So, it's pretty hard to believe ""Spooky"" is just a lame example of spooky horror."
"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even","The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even for someone who's done it.<br /><br />The story follows a group of college friends (the writers of The Running man) as they decide to go to the edge of the world, or to live on the outskirts of town for the good of all who follow along, regardless of circumstance (although it seems that a few are killed in cold blood or were murdered by a mad scientist), if they can escape the baddies. They all must make it. In this film, they are the people you will remember from previous ones and the way they live their lives. It's a very enjoyable flick, and as a director I will not be making a film about The Runabout if it ends this way. What follows is an extremely fun and sometimes surreal film. The film has several funny moments (especially the chase scene from the opening credits, but I prefer the original title) and is very fun to watch if you're not into horror movies. There are still some pretty good scares with some fun sequences, most notably the ""Giant S****!"" fight, which is actually quite the cool brawl of a fight between a couple friends.<a href="" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bE1rjRXyfQ"
