"By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's `Encounters of the Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic `A Better Tomorrow', `Zu Warriors' and the classic `Mr Vampire'","By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's `Encounters of the Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic `A Better Tomorrow', `Zu Warriors' and the classic `Mr Vampire' -- but Hongkongers still didn't know the genre or the medium was just a series of scary film clichés, a few obscure lines, and a bunch of cheap tricks to fool us into thinking that there is a movie to be made.<br /><br />The original HK Hong Film was the best thing in the Hongkyuk film industry, as that country was so far away in its history and so big the makers knew that no Hong kung Wan film would come to fruition until it could be seen by the mainland people for the first time and be shown with a wide audience in Hong Kung Fu films. Since then they have developed so many of these films since then with 'The Master of Kung', with almost 200 million copies being sold worldwide in those parts of China.<Br / Images: John Wong (credited as 'Sir Su Hong'... of `Tung Kae Hong'), Chan-Wook Wong from `Chang Chan' (who plays ""Jack of Darkness""), David W.

"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards from the bottom. The film also shows us exactly how important it is to be able to live in this country, how much we want the country to change, where we can live, what we see and what happens in the present. But all of these things are interconnected on both levels and are very different from a story, as well as from an art, a drama and a film.<br /><br />""Whirling is the key"" is a superb piece of film."
Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made,"Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made - in fact, it has made this movie the best film I have ever seen in my career. There are quite funny scenes throughout this film. The songs were by a great number of great singers such as John Waters, Miles Davis, Robert Wagner, Frank Sinatra and John Coltrane.<br /><br />There is no question in all this that there is a whole generation of very talented singers - not only to great musicals, but people who will love, revere and listen to every single singer in America. People who love to sing, love music (especially Americana, Americanas Creed) as much as they love film and music, and in particular will listen, hear and hear every song in the country. You may laugh as you do the songs as we have already done so many many times over. I thought that was a very touching comment on a film that will probably never be seen again. It doesn't matter what music the song is - it will forever be remembered. <br/><BR />I have watched the movie dozens of times and can tell you, from beginning to end, that it is an enchanting movie - especially for the great fans of this wonderful musical.<BR />, I cannot deny that you may wonder, as I"
"I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE","I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABEUS. There are many movies where people don't come to terms with the fact that they may not live with their ""normal"" life, and they also have it in common with BIBERNADOR, CHILDREN & DR. EYVEN. But this was the first ONE that was so incredibly accurate and beautifully told about human flaws. It made me so aware of the flaws in everyone else. <br /><br />The first film is more about the family, than the main characters, that this movie follows. The plot is far more complex with more than one person taking care of this person, aunts, grandkids, aunt and niece at a time. In fact, we know through flashbacks that the characters are human in their nature and there is no artificialization in those moments. We are not given personal stories, relationships. Each character is someone that needs a place to stay and a way to feel happy, normal, as well as beautiful. This can really be a part of who and what the character wants.<br/>< br />If I had to choose a film of my life in which I loved the story, then this would be my choice.<div id=mv_jqcv7_o6c7r"
"* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality ","* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality  This series was meant to be a good comedy, it would have been great for teen groups around the world that would be really disappointed. As a result i think this is a very good series if you watch it by 6 or 7! <br /><br />If you love the style of acting the show has, then see I Do Love it (1986) because they both deliver, with the same director; James Cameron. In the first part of this series it was an excuse for a show that was originally ""hot"" and was actually ""cool,"" so now we are in 2001, where the acting is fantastic, a great actor and producer here, he provides the most genuine portrayal that i've seen his name on todays screen. Cameron's work is also very well done, you can tell he is very interested in his characters, and not in any particular character. <besides his comedic antics and characters here are two superb examples of how his style works. The first is his ""jokes"" in a way, his mannerisms are amazing, from the simple and humorous expressions and he acts with conviction and sincerity, to the very nasty, nasty and racist attacks, the second is how he works, because he tries his best to make his character lik"
This is a really fun movie,"This is a really fun movie to watch! As long as you're not expecting anything good, don't waste your time or money. There may be some people out there who can't find anything redeeming about this movie. This little movie did one thing: it wasn't stupid! If you can appreciate movies such as this, you probably should!"
Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues,"Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues and tries to cover it up with their friendship (but they fall for the very girl she's attracted to) to keep her away from him.<br /><br />When her brother (Eric Schleider) tries blackmailing her and demanding that she pay child support from his bank, she tries unsuccessfully (even though he knows all about it), and also against his will to get her the money she'd been hoping for but he gives her, and she tells him off on a false story and keeps him on the case.<Br / Idiocracy is a perfect movie for anyone who thinks that someone in their position can be more powerful than their boss."
"When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure","When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure and one of the worst films of it all, and it deserved to be condemned...a fine film, if you are into the horrors of cinema.<br /><br />This film was filmed at the turn of one century and a third of a century after the publication of Dostoyevsky's ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", and from then on it has become a major hit in film making circles worldwide and has sold, both as a new and timeless masterpiece and in popular film and television.<b />It is an exceptional and compelling study of human beings and how they cope with the challenges of survival, from the personal and the economic realities of their times to the cultural challenges that are facing their people today.The film is made up of fascinating portraits in various landscapes, each representing a different facet of mankind.< br />While the film's portrayal of humanity differs dramatically from that written - as portrayed elsewhere in the book - the work is highly effective in making us understand most fully that human nature is not the product of individualism, but rather a universal construct. The film works in a way that is deeply personal, loving and sympathetic, giving us deeper insight into humanity beyond the borders of time. <br < br />The music, too, is unique to this"
"Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions)","Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions) in comparison. It has a great story, nice sets, very high production values, and quite a bit of comedy. And a special soundtrack by Michael B. Jordan and Jeff Bridges - the latter of which may be some of the best-known indie-rock performers of those times.<br/><p><2) One of very few European-made movies released after 1928 in the U.S. as a feature film...<b) I didn't see the film and thought the cast was a little silly. What I got from the DVD was an assortment of pictures by director Fredrik Niederhoefer. Some of them were good, some were awful, but they weren't bad, since they did not try to tell any interesting things. For starters, Niehaus had made a German-American release of this film in 1932, only to fall into serious depression in 1934. The Germans were in a very serious position at the beginning of World War II, when in order to escape Allied influence, they were sent on a train to Italy where they tried to return to their countries (as promised) to fight on their former home front as soon as possible. That plan failed, as the Nieshaus soldiers got out of hiding and began attacking what they believed"
"Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls""","Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls"" along the avenue, where the black boy is always caught. In this first part of the piece he is ""scared"" away by an older man who has just graduated from high school. His mother takes him to see her mother's older sister, with whom she goes to ""rehabilitation"" for her daughter. A great scene ensues as the ""drama queen"" (who I suspect could have been played by a black actor) leads a group of ""couples who live in a white neighborhood"". That scene is an inspiration for us to watch other scenes of drag queen-style life. It also includes ""a great song by the singer that just screams 'Crazy!' In fact, I'm quite certain that it has a great singing song. The lead singer, Billy Ray Brown, adds some extra touches and is also one of those rare musicians who really does a good job. I've never seen Brown sing or sing the part that we all love to. There is a lot to consider here. He actually sings a very beautiful song on the song, which is not hard to find at all. Many drag stars are very talented and this is one the highlights of this part. This movie is really a must see for all colorists and drag fans."
I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals,"I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals, but it might be a decent effort.<br /><br />For those of you expecting great humor and/or clever action, avoid this movie. It's nothing like ""King of the Hill"" or ""The Evil Dead,"" it's too simple to the core. If you are not familiar with it, try not to go all out with a bunch of dead people eating each other after a fight and a giant, mutated spider. You will be stunned."
"If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie","If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie of its type. However I thought it was better than the movie that came after it and that is where this one falls into the category of ""great originality of a movie"". I was completely disappointed.<br /><br />I do have a small gripe though as the only reason to buy this is because it comes with a great little book on acting. I really wanted to like this film, but the writing style, plot and storyline was all incredibly bland and annoying to me throughout the entire thing.<b /br]I felt I needed to pick up this little movie if I could, so I rented it. After spending some time with it I found that it had great acting, an entertaining story and definitely deserves more recognition. If you've ever come across a bad movie, this will most certainly make you wish you had it instead of the original.<em>I have to give it a 4/10. While I didn't feel the film was wasted on the actors or storyline I wanted it to be, I want the special effects and photography to last me through most of it.<p/b]Very disappointing."
"You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life","You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life and how he finally comes to terms with his feelings. In particular, the episode begins with Lois and Clark trying to explain each other to each others in their quest to find the missing boy. The whole point of the show, as explained in the movie, was that ""the child was not lost, but was just gone"". Now, there is quite an amount of suspense in everything we do in this finale. There are so many twists and turns at the end that it seemed like there was no end to everything, so no explanation (which would have been impossible). So, for example, Lois is upset on hearing her father was killed by what looked like a rocket. Of course, ""he knew his grandfather"". Even so, it was clear that the two men had a long history to go through. So we are not only rooting for Lois, we also root for Clark. Unfortunately, here, this is a huge spoiler, and will get you completely bored with the entire movie.<br /><br />Finally, to tell you the truth, I really hated the ending. For the good of all the family, Clark had to come back to his old place, only to realize something that had completely gone horribly awry. Why did he keep saying that to Lois in his"
"After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth","After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth (I remember only those parts that worked for me and the one that didn't) and that the action could be summed up much better, with a twist that was very clever and well known in the martial artists history."
"""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life ","""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life!!! This show has great comedic potential but it is definitely not one that fans of ""The Simpsons"" love to hear because it's so funny!!! I'm glad because I loved it and was able to sit through almost all of it!! It's funny and makes you laugh so much!!! My family loved the show! The Simpsons are such a great sitcom and I thought that I'd also like to get this show back on TV so that they can grow their fan base and become even more fan of me because a lot of times I watch them on television and they have been my family! I got a copy of this and it came out years ago!!! Wow I don´t think it was worth the download fee! Now I have to watch it again and so I just want to add another comment that people need to see!!"
i loved this movie,i loved this movie and as his favorite character the movie was a must see. He also had no need to read a book and never got bored reading it. I think the movies were entertaining and if i could see this in my head the next day it would. i give This movie a 7 for the sheer entertainment and i was amazed at just how easy it was fun for me and my kids. The movie is a MUST SEE for all ages and for a family who loves to watch the adventures of Jack Frost and Jack Bauer.
"The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff","The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff, while the plot is well done, with plenty of laughs throughout. If you haven't seen the movie, I recommend it. It was one of my high schoolers' high points.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for the three fans who still cherish the classic movie.

"This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela","This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. The main reason I like the film so much is because it is not one of Shakespeare's ""fable"" (the book is written by a Latin American writer). The documentary shows that the events occurred in a very specific and very predictable manner in order to make sense of their timing. I recommend you take the time to see the documentary on a high level. It is a must see as you are going to be watching history unfold while also feeling the same kind of feelings of loss and grief you felt when watching Romeo and Juliet with friends. Watching this documentary is an amazing experience because I have never felt so strongly as a friend or loved one in any way except when you watch it live. We always go to many things to experience our feelings. So if you're going about seeing the real events of that year, don't be afraid to look for your memories. Although sometimes you may find yourself wondering what will happen next (even if it seems impossible), I would recommend having some fun in this movie."
This is a masterpiece footage in B/W 35mm film,"This is a masterpiece footage in B/W 35mm filmography with outstanding story line, actors, special effects, and editing that will leave you breathless for days. The cinematography, great voice-over narration, incredible special effect effects and effects at the cinematics are all here in this ""remix"", made for everyone with love of cinema and I love it even more now! From simple to brilliant film making, it delivers the perfect balance and suspense you have come to expect from 'The Matrix' as an excellent and well-crafted feature film! For those who prefer a simple yet intense story, I highly recommend this movie as I think the cast and crew make such an absolutely fantastic team, this is my very first film to really give an effort to film, in a way that is absolutely worth watching if your a fan of films so you will LOVE it! It doesn't really work as a horror film though, the visuals are fantastic, as well cinematically stunning and it is very satisfying to watch how a man that does not look like a normal human being can save his life in such a moment... I loved the ending to the film as there it literally just ends - so simple really, is it one of those film that has so much promise but doesn´t make much sense and the actors themselves are superb.. as"

"This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments","This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments. That's what makes this so clever and interesting in the first place. What is interesting, however, is that it didn't just work at times with the usual characters, but also with several in different roles. You would expect for a series on a very big screen comedy to have a great ensemble cast. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. The most famous character is ""Cypress."" Her name is so popular she has appeared on TV commercials, even though she is not one to be noticed but for her humor and her comedy talent.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes with Cyp is when the show is hosted by a comedy actress, as she talks about the jokes that are put on the table and who gets to choose which jokes they put upon themselves. She is such a good comedian, I really wanted to see how she improvised from her own comedy routines. I loved her work, and one final quibble, there is some music to the tune of music by the rock band the Red Hot Chili Peppers. In addition to that, the music in The Twilight Nest also has some great music from the other episodes, such as ""Tiny Wings,"" ""The Music Machine,"" and ""Shower.""<br/><span style="""
Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen for the first time. The movies were all the same from beginning to end, yet all of them in a way that made the films look as real and authentic as the real world we're living our lives through. This is an original world created by a real guy who went to work at J. A. Smith's Disney Studios for several years, working as part of a very unique company who built their film studio, the JAGS PRINTED BAND from 2001 to 2007 and released a sequel in 2003 and now it's our turn to see this original film! I'm not sure how you could ever come into a movie of that magnitude, but this movie is a really amazing look into the fairy tale from its beginnings as a film. Just imagine what a world would have looked like if this film was made today...<br /><br />I also just highly recommend this masterpiece from the heart of Walt Jago, making him one of my idols of all time; it even made me smile with happiness every time I saw this great film..I always thought it was his greatest film, and it still stands up today with a timeless beauty to it!"

"When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987)","When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987) but I really got the impression this was meant for black/white audiences as the film had a good laugh, the story and the special effects were nice and all the shots in this movie were really exciting.<br /><br />I think the movie is fun to watch if you are into horror movies, or you don't like them and are willing to endure a lot more than you would have without it. I do like the concept of being stalked by vampire's at night and that's fun and worth seeing.<possible spoiler warning - please see all of the other reviews).<br't sure if this is what you'd be looking for? Then check out ""Fatal Attraction"" or ""Bloody Dracula"" for the scary movies that can be found out the hard way in less than 2 minutes.<honest comments by some of you on this ""movie"" are VERY BAD!

"I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban","I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban, but after seeing it as a young man, I don't feel any pity for the poor black youth trying to make the most of it: It made me laugh. I was very proud of that moment... A moment after it aired on Sunday night on Fox, the people I loved loved it--not a white woman. A very beautiful person--a very handsome person. But sadly, we had lost some key elements of the country. It's hard to understand why our government hasn't made more efforts, especially when you look at the bigoted and divisive anti-immigrant backlash that we've seen in the past year or so and how easy it would be for any group of people like me to say no to Trump."

To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made,"To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made for that particular genre. It's very original, engaging, moving, and really just beautifully executed. You get to find out the truth about how a young person is able to live a life just like that of John Waters - a film that will give you a vivid insight into the people who made that film (and in my opinion that is one of the most memorable performances in modern cinema). A Life of Love is a very very emotional movie, with moments of sadness, joy, sorrow, happiness and happiness. John Carpenter also directed some memorable films such as Death In A Bucket, which is about a great, happy, family film which can be seen today in Hollywood. A life of love, a beautiful, intelligent and intelligent movie."
"I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth","I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth when compared to the others I've just mentioned. I don't have a problem that it doesn't take as long as the other films do, just not in ""The Man From the Iron Throne, The Evil Dead"" and ""Dark Shadows 2"", which have been around since the 90s. Yes, Dark Shadows is shorter than the last two films but it hasn't been so short due to it being on DVD.<br /><br />As for The Man from the Ice Throne I really enjoyed it for a few years while I waited for Dark Nights 3 to hit home. Though Dark Nightmares 3 wasn't my cup of tea, I was absolutely captivated by this flick more than I ever have with any other horror flick. Of course it may come off as a bore, as I believe this was an attempt to ""make a film that isn't as scary"". It got me hooked and a lot of horror fans (well, some of the ones I'm sure didn't think very much at the time) got the chance to see it. Sadly it didn´t work and since it was never released on video, its very hard to compare it to anything. Overall the film was a really solid one for this time period, definitely worth getting back into."
"I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do","I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do. I remember it very well in my time of watching it, being a little scared, it reminded me a lot of the movies of our grandfather's (and grandmother's in the movie), as we were never really able to see his body or mind again, much less fully come to terms with his past, when we'd be born with the truth that he was a great man, but he died long ago, leaving behind no other explanation whatsoever, no family that would recognize him from any other generation, or at least had no hopes for finding him in life. This movie never left me, although my grandparents in a ""tear in"" at the end make me realize that in addition to these great things the reality has left us with no one in common, who we could identify with and love, as well without ever needing to tell someone to. The fact is that no matter what you look like from the outside, all you see in your face is your family and friends, every single life you have. It seems like each day this wonderful movie made no difference to us, the other kids, we made to laugh and cry everyday, for the people who made this ""movie."" I enjoyed my childhood memories much more than the adults of those years, just when they wanted"
This is a brilliant political satire,"This is a brilliant political satire that explores issues that will affect you as you watch it. The film is full of great dialog, with a great amount of insight and humor sprinkled throughout, which will make you laugh and feel like you are watching a masterpiece."
You play as B,"You play as Burt Ward who's been married almost 50 years and whose wife has given birth to two children, but they've seen the life of John Cusack. He's more in love with Eddy than he's with himself yet to see anything in him; he also gets married twice and is divorced once.<br /><br />The story seems a bit silly at times but the acting is superb and the characters are really strong. A bit of comedy in this flick as Ward and Ward keep making the same connection with each other but sometimes even more because they're in the story at first. Definitely not a classic but a great movie to watch!!<br/><ref />9 /10"
This film caught me by surprise,"This film caught me by surprise and at the same time impressed me on a new and exciting level of film-making. Having attended the screening, I can safely say that I thought the film's message is that love and romance are about going beyond being superficial. I know you have seen this many times - but it isn't about this simple love for others. As well I think you will agree that there is nothing dull or boring about the movie - a romantic journey in many ways or an experience which is both beautiful and intense.<br /><br />So, let's give the ending a chance.

THE JIST: See something else,"THE JIST: See something else with other characters that get killed, or just get thrown behind walls when you try to escape (which I did not).<br /><br />There were a few very good performances as well as some really awesome fight scenes which were worth the wait. It was a very funny film that really captured the spirit of the original trilogy (I'm pretty sure many people watched it for the soundtrack, but sadly some people did the DVD version of it too. Sorry!) and still manages to bring some excitement throughout."
"Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank","Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank. We meet her at a bank that has a staff that have all sorts of problems and they don't know what happened. She says she met a lady on a date and left, having gotten pregnant with a child that was the result.<br /><br />I've seen some films with this type of type who are not as good as this and I think it's a terrible movie: not good enough to entertain an American audience."

This is what makes me proud to be British,This is what makes me proud to be British and French. I don't have a problem with British accents. You would expect something from a British accent to come across as Italian - it is so cliché in both English and British history. But it makes the film one of the best ever made. It deserves to get the chance it deserves.
"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today. It is well crafted and very fun and the characters are all excellent. The story itself is very different to the earlier series and provides great insight for the viewers, they learn about the current times and how they can change the world to work effectively and do something that everyone wants.<br /><br />Mimi Ota is great in all three films as her father and her husband. She is a very sensitive person. Her heart is much more open, her emotions are so open and true, in every scene. Some believe that by being together, she gives all that she does to others, for us. We can laugh at her mistakes, but the truth is, everyone works their way to happiness.<BR />This movie is probably one of my favorites because of some wonderful dialog, some memorable scenes that have a certain emotional depth, it is just one great film!<br/><strong>8/10"
"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love and happiness and often thought of others as the true lovers of the people they are supposed to be serving. The idea of ""loving"" persons as strangers (who may be true or true) also seems popular and has gained a wide popularity. Today, this is no longer the case, and a very different way of viewing the characters we meet or have the pleasure of meeting and interacting with, or who we like.<br /><br />A popular theory about the love of love is that it is a human bond from which people feel and come to love each other, by being loved to different people, in many peoples' and cultures' situations. Some people who are in this state or find themselves suffering from it may consider it a positive experience, but they may not understand the meaning of it in the present day, what makes us in love. Others might regard this as a dangerous feeling of depression and need to live out that suffering. In the long term we must become very, very aware of that, as people may get very old or start to feel some sort of spiritual or psychological crisis.<br/><bnw3.com/images/l/1/9.85750199/L/b.p83724"
Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism in the film - and in its own way. The result is not of the script - but a mixture of all those elements which have become familiar throughout the years.
"The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious","The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious I was laughing out loud at all the jokes. Oh, for the love of the movie, does that make the cast all of three, I guess.<br /><br />So there you have it... I think that this was an absolute disaster in every way and I'm sure I will never write another review about it and get any of this right... but I can tell you that even worse... The fact that the producers wasted one more year filming this movie and decided to have a script that was so unbelievably cliché and ridiculous that it's hard to believe their decision to spend it directing (and even considering how much money, time and resources they had dedicated to this production) means that by just having this crap shot off and shot from start to finish they couldn't have even succeeded in getting an audience interested. Just plain stupid."
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films. Even with many flaws.<br /><br />So here's a story with so much symbolism (i.e. the ""twister's"" in the title, and how the monster in a coffin is identified) and some plot twists that are very interesting. There's no pretense there. The filmmakers do a great job showing us more than we are in real life (like in ""House on Haunted Hill""), as shown by the creepy old man's hand to hand combat. Plus, one of the characters, called Jarl Krasinski, makes a delightful supporting cameo appearance as the old monster. This is one movie that will be the first to use this, for as long as I can remember."
"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even","The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even if the plot line was well done.<br /><br />The rest of this film is just an incredibly bad excuse to bash the worst acting department ever released. The cinematography is horrible, the soundtrack sucks, and the movie has no direction whatsoever. It's also a boring, boring movie without even trying."
