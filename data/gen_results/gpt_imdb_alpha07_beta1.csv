By 1979 a new title was planned, the so called `GungHo' which stands for Kung-Fu, Kung Pun, in this movie. Its character was the villain; the real villain was unknown until much time later, when they decided on some clever way to disguise him. Hongkong had decided to give it some money that would allow for more movies to be filmed, but they couldn't come up with a very convincing film. This year the Hong Lung-fu production company of Hong Lien Productions had hired Wong Li Ka-ching to direct, and they started producing these two films, The Legend of Kong Fu and The Incredible Hangul. From the first they set out to build a monster statue, as a means of making an important cult film, not something they wanted for kids, so they had this new production, Kong Kung Fu, made specifically for young children. Their film was very good, with great casting and fantastic visuals. It was all released on DVD but has since been deleted, it has its time on it.<br /><br />It's really no surprise to see that Kong Kong's cult of over 50,000 fans is based on the original Kung fu.

Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl. It's a very funny movie, filled with good humour and a decent storyline! It works so well, I think I'll be having a hard time viewing it since I'm not allowed to change the channel. I love Greyolos movies but this is not one of them!"
2,"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards through the political and economic system. The story moves so fast that the audience can see it clearly but the editing is very good to show us the depth and energy of what is really happening, especially of a young actress in her twenties. In French the main focus is young Marie Claire, for whom it is a personal choice not to commit crimes. If you compare the director with Rene Matisse in the past and Rolle Rifoul and Francois Guillot in ""The Descent,"" you can compare Raulle to Rufus and see the similarities. ""Rulle"" is also similar to ""Ostinémoire,"" that was directed by René. There is an eerie atmosphere in France and one of Rieu's best works. This does not do much justice to the other films, and ""Les Bien Vert"", which was the only French feature made in America. It is the kind of movie where you will have to pay attention to several times more than what the subtitles say before you watch the movie. You will want to get some of that on your DVD, as it adds to great pleasure in watching it. Also the acting by Toulouse and Tillefis reminds you how great French acting is nowadays. They all"
3,Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made,"Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made by a Disney-maker. It is not merely great films or good movies; it was always fascinating to watch when my favorite Disney characters suddenly appeared on the screen. I have not seen one more Disney movie featuring Walt Disney before going to bed in the night, and I do enjoy hearing them rhyme each other when they're talking. The movie is a simple matter of finding the right time to start filming, but the script makes the movie, without over-rating, perfect. You are not missing much, the acting is excellent, I am very happy I only rented it because of my dad. After watching it, my parents would sit up and sing along to the soundtrack as he was telling the story. This movie was worth viewing just to see some of his movies. Disney has always been a very talented director/producer/writer, yet they created their characters and developed a strong storyline and character while making it so entertaining to look at and watching. Watch it and you will see how great these Disney movies can be, they never let you down and love the characters they create, as they are never so naive to do something new or different in life as often they do. Also, even though he is constantly telling different stories, this movie will always remind you of all"
4,"I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE","I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABEAT: ""You made me cry"" is not the same song as ""I'll never go back to being a person."" The movie makes the ""Crying"" cliché in the movie seem real, since it is true all the way from Troma's release. I believe this movie is based on a real story.<br /><br />I would never compare two great comedies (I also like ZORA): I would be lying if I said this ""ponytail"" had the talent to portray the character of ""Otto."" Maybe the best comparison I can make is this one. The story is very similar in tone, with very different characters. However, the main difference is the fact of the difference between the two stories.<p/a] <branonymous"

The first one, as you read the synopsis, was basically: a fight that started out in the same battle where there was no one other than the old teacher, the guy in charge of that new school/receiving all students to the finals.<br -P) And what could have possibly occurred? The whole idea of this fight is that everyone who is a part of a school should stand up and fight... And let's face it, this is NOT a good time of fighting, even not in this bad school where nobody says anything... But, what really counts is, if the fight had been in a bad way, that would be absolutely ridiculous, would make the whole thing seem ridiculous if it wasn't. This episode was even worse as all fights had a big bad guy, there's no fight outside of fight in, really, like in other stories we've seen.<-P, but thats another day. Well, now that i've said all that, just go to sleep for a few days (I was hoping that the"
6,This is a really fun movie,"This is a really fun movie. Very interesting character development is also given to the movie, and this movie is extremely intriguing. It has a lot of funny moments that are memorable. The cast is great, especially the women. They are very powerful, likable, very likably dressed, interesting, charismatic, etc. All in all, I would recommend this. If someone you know is out to find out where to start this, this will be the answer to that question. As for the film itself, the production is OK, but what's the point? A lot. You just kind of love it.<br /><br />The movie starts very well and it goes on for really, really long. There are some very good scenes in the cast, such as at the beginning (a couple of scenes) and they make an interesting ending. In general, with the way things are going out in life, people go out with some strange dreams about killing people, making fun of the ""others"" for being idiots, or getting jealous of people. I suppose it is that simple with ""the movie's themes"" and that it has all that. However, once you get to know this film better, some of that is gone, like the characters go from being just silly ""bad"" to"
7,Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues,"Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues.<br /><br />The film is a beautiful experience of courage and dignity. We see a remarkable scene that is the highlight of the movie: the man getting dressed in the same outfit as a character that had been shot over and over again, never to be found again. She is in this case a true survivor, who is having flashbacks of what was really going on. I was totally transfixed right from the beginning. And, of course, there is one scene in which we get flashbacks. It's also worth watching, but nothing can rival it, without the sheer physical force of it.< br />Director of photography Luis Fosco also has to show us a very unique way of being in Paris during the 1920s. At times even the great scenes in front of us are difficult to miss, because, together with the music, we are allowed to experience what it meant to the people and places to which our time was dedicated. To appreciate this aspect is an achievement, and a great reminder that time is not everything."
8,"When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure","When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure because it lacked any compelling characters or compelling plot. That was the case with ""Dead Men Lying"" in 1971. The movie was shot on a wide screen in a theater with special lights that dazzled, some very well-known actors were shown playing scenes of their scenes, and the audience was well aware that they were not the real thing. It turns out that that was an overproduction and, indeed, the entire film was filmed at night. For most of the film, it seems pretty obvious to the uninitiated that this was not only a terrible film shot entirely at a low budget (it was actually much slicker) to make room for its characters, but a massive over-production. A script that had potential for amazing effects, a story that would be extremely fun to write and shoot, an excellent premise for a feature film directed with all of these elements in place, was badly missed. What the heck happened?<br /><br />Director John Cargill, as always, seemed to be quite good in this. All that really happened in the movie is that he made several bad edits to various locations, like some poor camera work and lighting, editing that never had the chance to move the camera (for a script); he tried by lighting"

10,"Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls""","Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls"" where they perform all kinds of musical dances. The film includes a cast including: David Lean with Fred Astaire, John Candy, Raffy Anderson, and Larry King. It was also featured on TV at the 1986 Oscars including ""Man of the Year"" and ""Wedding with the Stars"", both of which were nominated for Best Picture again. You'll even hear Jim Carrey sing one of those songs while on stage at a bar. I love this film because it makes one wonder what it all was about. Of course it is a comedy that is totally sincere and fun to watch."

The way that Moksha was portraying is truly amazing. She is incredible. I wish I knew as much about her. When it came to women as in every other film she appeared to be a pretty blonde lady but she was beautiful and I'm just really glad I know she looks just like her.<sp / email): lindsay@mokha-film.nhsay.gov"
12,"If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie","If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie they make. I really wish they did a little deeper into the story rather than the typical Hollywood plot that would have you believe it all the way through. However, despite the numerous flaws in the entire film, it still succeeds."
13,"You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life","You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life.<br /><br />Clark's character is probably best known as an actor who acted a few more times with the ""Dirty Harry"" films. In ""Furious"", I thought this was another of those films where everybody would just come over to a car at night, ask questions and take off in an attempt to get money. I loved it.<b />I have to admit, I have a feeling that it was a hit, based on how much the whole movie had to say and what they knew, and I just think they made Clark in the dark to fit in just right."
14,"After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth","After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth to my present day. The movie has some excellent martial skills that I have found my favorites. Most of them I found as entertaining as they are. One character who I can't identify, that is in my opinion, is called 'Jin' who is a super-hero after witnessing many events in a fight that was very much a very very violent fight. Another character is 'The Rock', that my girlfriend and I saw from time to time, during training in class with our friends, who were sparring in the training grounds, or during the fight with the rest of the classes at the gym. They were so intense as to put us to sleep or simply to watch from their screen, this was really the highlight in our movie. I also saw it at a movie theater. It is quite enjoyable to see from a martial artist perspective. This movie is very realistic and full of tension and emotions. Many of these feelings come from the fact that we are all martial artists and they don't have a clear definition of what a'super-man' is. In the movie, in between a dozen fights where a rock falls out of a fighter's back, one of their own, and another when they start a fire fight or a fistfight, the hero goes completely"
15,"""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life ","""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life!!!!. Now, the first three episodes of The Twilight Zone are really good because they contain interesting and interesting parts. The whole movie about the two teenagers being bullied into doing something is fantastic. Plus that's the ending of this is funny and really clever. This is also one that has some funny moments because of it's relationship and love story. I found it interesting that at the end of every episode, we see the boys with a really strong friendship. However, when they meet up with their parents and go on a date, that they become friends really makes the story even better."
16,i loved this movie,"i loved this movie! She was super sexy and extremely attractive, i think she would do better than this film! The cinematography is also very good. I love the old scenes, especially from ""Screams"" the ""wicked"" scenes. This movie is good, I recommend it to all of us who love movies that will shock you. It's a film I really didn't know existed, so enjoy! 7/10! I couldnt be more happy about it."
17,"The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff","The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff, as it's an incredibly unfunny and unoriginal comedy about a female ""giant dick."" Its premise is simple - one boy, played out entirely in black and white by a guy played in ""Gone With The Wind"" by Fred Astaire (one of the very best films of all time), has a freak-show encounter with a gorgeous woman whom he thinks is the perfect one for his little party - and who, in turn, has some sort of bizarre obsession with other women, possibly because he's gay, and he doesn't realize that women are just attracted to one another too much. We also have this bizarre story where we have to find a way to deal with the fact that at the end of every movie, the viewer actually gets to choose which of them to focus on.<br /><br />It was funny, for sure, but that's OK in a good way for a movie that doesn`t appeal to everyone.< br / >The screenplay is great (and that`s the point). The acting is just outstanding. The jokes are great too (if you don't know the plot, don`T watch it). And overall, there`ll be plenty of laughs in it. As I stated, unlike Gone With the Wind,"

Instead, the audience was left with a number of complex events which, ultimately, left its subjects with questions they cannot answer and yet they do. Not only are many important events happening, these also include the assassinations of Chasun, whose real name was Hugo Chavez, his rule, and his rise to power, all while the political leaders are under constant threat and the situation is becoming more and more dire. What the filmmakers, especially Mr. Fuentes and Mr Dias, show is an entirely different view of Venezuelan politics than what we might find on the TV. <br/><span id=""selection-marker-box_1""><br class=""redactor-selection marker"" align=""center"" width=""100%"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""12"" allowfullscreen>Although I think that this film is more about the actual events and about how the people affected by them were affected, not by a single assassination attempt or even a mere assassination.<span class=redacted><small class="""" name= ""Venezuel"

This is one of the films best examples of British cinema in recent times.<br/><quote #6- The final scene where Peter shoots the cat 'Joe and his friends' with a large wooden stick. Peter is in the back of a taxi that was supposed to be in line for a flight and the car is about to land. The actor walks through London just as they are being photographed to set up the next flight so that the script writer then proceeds to make it a short lived one as the cab driver is on a crossfire. 'You want?' I don't know, was that his right? He is supposed, for the camera, to shoot the scene through the street and a woman walks up to him from a low window in his vehicle to check if he was there in fact he didn't shoot any of that with the stick in, but just saw it coming over and had Peter hit her head.

20,This is one of the best Bollywood movies i have seen up until now,"This is one of the best Bollywood movies i have seen up until now. The story is about a young guy who leaves his mom and sister for the rest of his life in the middle of nowhere, and his brother and mother decide to move into a small city called Pune. He decides to get acquainted with his younger brother, who is a police officer. On his way he meets the guy he liked best: a bad guy. It's a mystery of sorts but no one suspects him. There are lots of twists and turns in this movie with lots and lots. I also liked the soundtrack a lot, especially the score by K.S. Pramod. Also good is the direction and direction of Sam Thafur. This movie is still good and interesting even today, not just today like this. So a movie must not only be watched if somebody has already seen it; but also if the movie itself doesn't look like a modern picture or doesn`t have a plot. For my money this is probably the worst movie of all time."

The production design is beautiful, but the music is pretty good and the special effects are pretty cool when there's really nothing to worry about. I gave it a 9."
22,Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen with his three children (Minnie Mouse, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Fairy Godmother and The Flaming Lips) to help create a musical that will entertain audiences from childhood to youth, giving children and adults a chance to grow up with the characters that give them so many memorable tales. The story and characters are just as engaging and colorful, each tale is based on several stories, stories we learn together and that others have done more to create today's animation and movie culture than any other Disney animation that has ever happened on earth.<br /><br />All children have their own unique special talents, that all children love, and each play an important role in the lives of their parents.<Br /></br><Br />The theme song is an excellent choice, playing throughout most of Disney's films at both levels of animation. I love the music and have read and understood the songs of other artists, but all the people involved and audiences alike, are really glad for it. In all honesty, every Disney filmmaker that ever worked with Walt was very nice to me. They worked very hard to make this movie possible and all of my children could be happy with it.<BR /"
23,I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it,"I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it without having to get a new Shakespeare textbook. My husband and I went out for a beer and a while I got it back from the store and we stopped by a bar to look at the two of them and it was one of the funniest things we've ever encountered. We laughed hysterically by the end of it. It was amazing, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to really laugh with any emotion out of their heart. You'll cry every time you see it right there, with a real sense of humor out there."
24,"When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987)","When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987) and ""Torna"". Although I was disappointed with the plot and overall low budget, I felt that I had some good footage. Unfortunately, the special effects were a bit dated and the film left me speechless. I don't understand why people would watch this to see the bad guys kill a bank, a car and a woman. Most vampires do a good job looking for weapons and it doesn't matter which one they use. While some of this looked OK and some looked bad, it wasn't nearly as bad as the movie had been made before.<br /><br />Like many fans of American Vampire films that don`t see vampires in films, this movie seems to go out of its way to make people think it might be a ""nice"" vampire movie so they put everything into it. If you`re looking to pick up a vampire that isn`ts really bad then don´t miss this."

That being said, I definitely wanted to see this show again so much to enjoy more of it...as a whole I could recommend it....and the cast gave it a 5.5 out of 10, which means this is indeed a one of those show you may love. With the recent success of Star Trek The Next Generation, that should change. If you find yourself thinking a little that is still a waste to waste precious nights of your life (which are actually the most enjoyable) don't let this movie fool you. All that and the incredible talent behind this fantastic show will be sorely missed."

29,To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made,"To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made from the director's side. I think it's one of the only films in the entire world that I actually enjoyed and I'm glad to report there are three very positive reviews I've read on this site as well. To say that this film was okay would be an understatement to say. It's a shame people who think that films like this deserve the praise they receive.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the writer has a tendency to paint a harsh picture of his work. Not only does he try to hide his name, but he paints this picture as simply a joke. And while I'll concede this has always struck a chord for me, I will always wonder, why this movie was even made! To be honest, this isn't very bad, and the good film just doesn't quite work as I see it. Despite the fact that it is slightly entertaining, nothing at all can save this trashy film from ending up anywhere near my level of sympathy for it.<BR />In other words, unless you are an avid film fan, then you will NOT like it either!<br roundtoughness: 0/10<BR /><strong words: 10/50"
30,"I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth","I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth, not really a movie to watch for kids, or for people who are a ""teen"". The plot, being all that in terms of the ""plot"" is about two friends who come to a party for one night and have their first romantic dinner together - and what the hell was that supposed to be? - to the party. It doesn't. I don't know... it's like a half hour of nothing but laughter, like the whole thing! That's kind of sad, honestly, unless you want to get the point across to you as a teen. (One more thing - I actually didn't watch the movie - but hey, that was before my father was in it).<br /><br />And I'm not joking! It's also a little overbearing in its attempts to relate to kids and how they are different than other races, although it still manages to maintain a romantic touch with the subject matter and makes for a fairly good entertainment.<br/><Br />It's a rather dull movie. Not that its worth watching it, just that it could have served as one of those ""must see"" films for those who like being entertained. But it wasn't really worth its 10 stars or more, as it was a very short film so"

It's very fitting for the time period of that movie. This movie stands out as one of the most memorable Hollywood movie of all time - the one that was the highlight of every year.<br /><br />The story is great and the acting is superb. The film may not have been all that perfect since it was released, but it still holds up with the best I've seen: incredible acting and incredible sound and atmosphere.<pagebreak]"
32,This is a brilliant political satire,"This is a brilliant political satire of what was at the heart of the current political climate, and the importance of that to our security. It's the last thing the United States should be aiming for. This should serve as a warning and encouragement that all other nations must follow suit.<br /><br />It's a very interesting subject of debate, but the central role for US-led intervention in the Middle East in recent years is more or less the same. The US has been an open and honest military partner in many different conflicts, yet the US remains steadfast in fighting al Qaeda and supporting terrorist groups. In a similar vein, the President has repeatedly said that his government is not trying to overthrow the regime but is instead trying humanitarian efforts in areas like the North and South, which is largely supported by China and is supported, at least by, many US foreign policy advisors, particularly from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Turkey, Iran and Turkey.<Br /></br><Br />I do believe the ""humanitarian"" principle is the most logical at this point because it goes directly to the core of why the conflict with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was so important. However I strongly suspect that in some respects it is right, with a ""yes' (but still with some of history's"

34,This film caught me by surprise,"This film caught me by surprise during my first viewing as a child and at times even a little bit scary and sad. I've gone to great lengths to find some wonderful footage of the town at my own expense. The film is also perfect for the whole family of this movie that have the opportunity to meet each other the evening of their first night together and meet up for some beer.<br /><br />The only thing I really disliked about this film was my wife who is deaf! I'm not so sure about her, but considering the situation she was in, I doubt that I would watch something as terrible and disturbing as this. In fact after watching this it makes me feel very sad about what it will soon become a reality.<BR /></br>< br />"
35,I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival (now in its own right) last year. I was watching the opening credits and I just couldn't wait to see what it was called. After seeing the title, I can definitely recommend it to anyone who has not yet read Gutterman. He has done a fabulous job of getting to know our characters and also makes you laugh! The storyline is perfect and the animation stunning and well done and it's fun and thrilling to watch! If you haven't seen the movie yet, come and see this! I highly recommend this to everyone and wish I only knew the story. It's quite the journey for these great American actors, especially John Cassavetes and Joe Pesci.<br /><br />I have also found this film a treasure and a must watch for those who are into movies, comics, or other mediums."
36,THE JIST: See something else,"THE JIST: See something else this evening. I'm watching the film from the start of the movie. How did they call this film a Jist? JEST: I thought it was a B horror, but I forgot where to begin.<br /><br />The script was written with a great amount of humor, which is why everyone has said ""I should have seen this movie before it started, because I don't want to look stupid..."" But to see such an amazing movie was really refreshing. Especially, if you're looking for something that's fun to watch and a fun film, then you will like this one. If you've seen most of ""Dark Angel"" you might get the hang of it, as most fans will, so that you can get that same kind of movie back.< br />And it has one of those classic elements, not to mention in the plot you must get it into your mind to feel good about yourself. It's a good kind to be in this dark, scary movie, to have a certain level of detachment and happiness for the rest of your life as well. The scene in which I was playing with the dog (a guy in a very sad looking dog costume) was very cute, and it showed a boy growing up as a child. And"
37,"Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank","Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank. She is the opposite sex to all of the rest of them. How does she decide to get involved in the movie? Do they all have a story?<br /><br />This film was supposed to be about an affair.<br/>< br />I have seen a LOT of films that deal with things like this, but it felt a bit forced by the fact that there were two people getting engaged at a same time. It's very easy to see why there aren't more people involved.< br />But that made it quite hard to concentrate on the relationship between the two men.<Br />, and it made the story even more complicated to understand. <br ->And because i'm not a big fan of Hollywood movies, I have also never really watched movies that dealt with any of these things. I saw this at one of his movies and I actually really enjoyed it - but I've seen that movie on TV and not in movies. That said, this makes the film more complex and confusing to handle. This was not that difficult as a sequel.< Br />."
38,"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way, but in this one a new hero arrives at a haunted house, this time, a man whom they call the Black Mask. It's not just him that he's killed; the monster, they'll soon find out. Then, through the use of different colors, it's revealed all of this to mean a lot in ways we hadn't seen a whole lot of time before and that's how it fits. Director Robert Zieml and artist Matt Cusack both use their distinctive style to portray the story in such a way that the audience will not be forced into the action, their style in action film is also very believable and I can say honestly that none of these effects in here have been done before. The story itself is interesting and the special effects, look great with what we have, and look cool with the new one. There's enough of an idea here to make this a ""real"" dark and earthy horror movie with decent visual effects and a story that is so complex it could easily be adapted for television, so I really can't be too harsh on the cast just because I find that it is an excellent movie from Robert Zeidman and Matt Canz. This is a true ""Kuberi Brothers"" movie  even if it isn"
39,i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me,"i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me agreed...it was amazing! My main complaint about it is when they say that it's based on a true story this would turn out to be an unrealistic view I totally disagree on this fact. I thought the main bad guy was probably the villain of the film and it would give the writers and directors enough opportunity for them to make a new villain for this film. It should have had fun and had a great movie. The ending is a long read and the acting by a good cast could have been better. This is for the better folks who are bored of watching bad movies..it could be fun to watch and that's the message, but the only advice I would leave, is to keep watching a movie like this and make sure to rent it, because it doesn't have the same quality of tone, action or dialogue as the original movie..."
40,"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect","The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect from it. A typical one night stand is a night shift for all those under the age of 18. The rest are adults who just have the same experience of life, and who would like to live the life of an adult who knows what to do about his/her life issues while being under a rock. There's nothing inherently tragic about this film. This is about three main characters in a big city of the Philippines working together to bring down a corruption case involving three corrupt public officials, a criminal who runs a gang, two businessmen who run the drug trade, some friends who work for some of them and an old family that loves them very much. They all work together for the purpose of bringing the truth of corruption to the surface, while at the end of their tale there is an end quote about what happened to it all. We get to see a couple of families living in the area that have been given a break on the ground down there that some will want to leave for greener pastures or die out because there will be some political connections to this. Unfortunately those guys go into the water and there goes the story for them. One family says that they have no money and they start to die.<br /><br />We never get a look at these people"
41,This is what makes me proud to be British,"This is what makes me proud to be British. This is just one of the great things about it, and it's a shame that it didn't get the opportunity to come out in the first place. I am very proud of what we were doing - not just doing TV but also with the TV station, all the characters and the show. And I would agree that we do have a lot of respect for all those who can do so. Thank you guys for the movie."
42,"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today (although it's very much better than it first came out). The plot consists of a group of two thieves that rob a bank and they are joined by the evil thief (I'll say this because we don't see him coming again). But, in doing so, they lose everything at the bank, as well as many important things, including a fortune at another bank by a villain who wants the theft. The villain is a psychopathic liar. One of his crimes is to rob two banks with the accomplice in mind, the robber who also wants a large sum to go with it. But this guy is not that evil at all (and I thought he was good at it), but he wants to take over something of value for his partner. He has been robbing banks for far too long, so what is his excuse? How about robbing the others, but, instead of buying a big fortune--or if he thought this was a good excuse, buying some treasure? In short, he doesn't understand the crime as a whole, only that the criminals want for him money that he needs to make the robbery go faster.<br /><br />This is the third entry to the Colomotion series: the first was released in 1968. This time around, however"
43,"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love and tragedy; especially poetry and the novel. And yet in this age of ""love of a text, no one seems much interested in the poetry of the text; nor is the story of love interesting. Yet love is a mystery; it contains many elements; and why? Because you cannot say that the poem is inimical to the character you speak of, and so, in my opinion, you would have to say an insult at her. Perhaps in spite of her great talent, such a person had become a little too famous for herself.<br /><br />Although the film has been shot on very poor quality film (for such an impressive feature-length production, I am afraid I could not afford to pay for the ""films"" they must have shot in their hotel rooms), as I have given the impression it was filmed on a special level, the effects, sound effects and sound make it well beyond belief. Although the script itself was beautiful, there is that little bit of graininess and uninspired violence - very unlike the scenes that would be filmed or even edited on screen. The editing is excellent and is perfectly placed. I think that some filmmakers are in favour of film-making as a means of entertainment; but I find that this film is entirely"
44,Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism and the inability of mothers and families to heal the wounds inflicted to such a young, vulnerable, and vulnerable baby.<br /><br />This film is the antithesis of the ""feminists"" I have been thinking about since ""The Hills Have Eyes"" where I found mothers in tears for hours straight and I couldn't help but think that this movie should be seen as a warning to the rest of us that we need to ""watch out"" for the poor and needy, not just those who have to pay for what is, I hope, a life's work. I am not trying to preach, per se, the virtues of a mother, but rather, how often you would want to hear parents on the phone complaining about how their kid's daddy has gone too far in abusing them, being too nasty to give a lot of weight, or the fact that the most popular movie from the 80's was ""My Own"", the movie that started out as being the basis for this entire series of articles.<b />As I said on both the inside and outside of this film, ""Hels"" is a work of pure talent and a triumph to all involved. ""Thrift Shop is an excellent film. The characters are unique to this genre, yet its themes remain"

(implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious","The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious and not far behind the rest of the scenes but is just not very appropriate to the role played by the lead actress.<br /><br />The only other action sequence you'll see was the one where a female soldier is killed whilst carrying a grenade. But this was done for a few minutes then changed to a gunfight which ended in three minutes, so that the last few scenes of this feature were worth waiting and getting into. Just make sure no one is holding your attention when getting a good view and the whole thing seems too fast going.<Br />"
46,I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films - especially the kind we've seen in The House, and also to the beautiful costumes of the early '60s film, but I enjoyed this film immensely. The atmosphere is lively, the actors are credible, especially Elisha Cara, a brilliant actress and an excellent choice for the lead role.<br /><br />It also features fantastic performances by Robert De Niro and Mary Dolan among others. It's definitely a must see film to see. (I highly recommend it.)"
47,"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even","The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even for those who liked the previous films. The story is about two teenage boys (Shakespeare, Hamlet and John Wayne) falling in love while running around from a mad guy. Once they realize they were actually attracted to each other, they want to spend the rest of their life together in peace and bliss. There are also some very moving scenes in the movie and the atmosphere is very pleasant and you'll really get a sense of how far the characters went to create this happy and serene world of our modern world. It was truly very well done - so very realistic."
