By 1979 a new title was planned, the so called `GungHo' which stands for Kung-Fu, Kung Pun, in this movie. Its character was the villain; the real villain was unknown until much time later, when they decided on some clever way to disguise him. Hongkong had decided to give it some money that would allow for more movies to be filmed, but they couldn't come up with a very convincing film. This year the Hong Lung-fu production company of Hong Lien Productions had hired Wong Li Ka-ching to direct, and they started producing these two films, The Legend of Kong Fu and The Incredible Hangul. From the first they set out to build a better film, as a follow-up to `LungFu', which they didn't manage to make.<br /><br />'Lambo' is based on the adventures made by Lee Le-je's first movie, 'Thunderball' a few years later. It is pretty much a comedy, about a bunch of teenagers hanging out in a pub. In fact, it is very fun to watch as Lee's character is just a normal teen. The plot is mainly based upon this premise, although"

Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl. It's a very funny movie, filled with good humour and a decent storyline! It works so well, I think I'll be having a hard time viewing it since I'm not allowed to change the channel. I love Greyolos movies but this is not one of them."
2,"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards through the political and economic system. The story moves so fast that the audience can see it clearly but the editing is very good for filming. I can't stop crying when someone screams at me from the back of my head. Of course, all the action takes place around the beautiful, rural landscape of Le Bonne. It's easy only to see why people love to watch Paris - a city worth preserving and a place so beautiful that it is impossible to ignore. But I love this country and it's amazing that there are so many people walking around every day who don't feel the same way. My wife, our beautiful daughter and niece. This film made me want to make films for myself and my children and for all to enjoy. Jean Pierre Lafitte and Jean Girard de Marre have all great performances. They show us that we have the right to our country in our own right so that those affected by racism cannot hide and continue enjoying life in the present."
3,Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made,"Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made by a Disney-maker. It is not merely an epic thriller about the lives of a child and a girl who live in a world full of violence, chaos, violence and war. This film is no more.<br /><br />This movie should be seen by all children at all ages.<p><b />"
4,"I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE","I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABEAT: ""You made me cry"" is not the same song as ""I'll never go back to being a person."" The movie makes the ""Crying"" clich√© in the movie seem real, since it is true all the way from Troma's release. I believe this movie is based on a real story.<br /><br />I would never compare two great comedies (I also like ZORA): I would be lying if I said this ""ponytail"" had the talent to portray the character of ""Otto."" Maybe the best comparison I can make is this one. The story is very similar in tone, with very different characters. However, the main difference is the fact of the director's involvement. In ""Diana Farrow,"" he was responsible for most of this type of comedienne (in fact he is responsible now for THE BEAUTY AND THE CHAPEL). Although the title of a play suggests a romance, there is much more in LUMINAH that takes place than with that plot twist and the ridiculous love scenes.<br -P.S. - I saw this version of ZONA three years ago on VHS!< br />"

6,This is a really fun movie,"This is a really fun movie. Very interesting character development is also given to the movie, and this movie is extremely intriguing. It has a lot of funny moments that are memorable. The cast is great, especially the women. They are very powerful, likable, very likably dressed. Even when it's on the air, they're all very funny; even the lead roles always have a very strong theme. This would be best shown on TV in the winter."
7,Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues,"Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues.<br /><br />The film is a beautiful experience of courage and dignity. We see a remarkable scene that is the highlight of the movie: the man getting dressed in the same outfit as a character that had been shot over and over, and never to be found again. She is in this case a true survivor, who is having flashbacks of what was really going on. I was totally transfixed right from the beginning. And, of course, there is one scene in which we get flashbacks. It's also worth watching, but nothing can rival it, without the sheer physical force of it.< br />Director of photography Luis Fosco also has to show us a very unique way of being in Paris during the height of events during World War II. With ""My Day on Earth"", his camera shows no limitations around us as we experience the lives of people involved in these conflict against the forces of darkness. This film, also filmed at the University of Paris is an achievement in itself. The film demonstrates that all of reality can be depicted with some extraordinary sensitivity."
8,"When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure","When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure because it lacked any compelling characters or compelling plot. That was the case with ""Dead Men Lying"" in 1971. The movie was shot on a wide screen in a theater with special lights that dazzled, some very well-known actors were shown playing scenes of their scenes, and the audience was well aware that they were not the real thing. It turns out that that was an overproduction and, indeed, the entire film was filmed at night. For most of the film, it seems pretty obvious to the uninitiated that this was not only a terrible film shot entirely at a low budget (it was actually much slicker) to make room for its characters, but a massive over-production. A script that had potential for amazing effects, a story that would be extremely fun to write and shoot, an excellent premise for a feature film directed with all of these elements in place, was badly missed. What the heck happened?<br /><br />Director John Cargill, as always, seemed to be quite good in this. All that really happened in the movie is that he made several bad edits to various locations, like some poor camera work and lighting, editing that never had the chance to move the camera (for a script); he tried by lighting"

10,"Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls""","Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls"" where they perform all kinds of musical dances. The film includes a cast including: David Lean with Fred Astaire, John Candy, Raffy Anderson, and Larry King. It was also featured on TV at this time, which may have been a great moment and perhaps one of the most underrated movies that have ever been released. This production (which I personally still use) was based upon an old newspaper advertisement that called for an introduction for the young people of NYC and they were invited in to perform. We learn about two young guys who arrive in New York seeking a job. A black girl who is from Louisiana and wants to marry, is denied admission to the show as she is not Hispanic. However, the white person takes part in the ceremony. With a huge audience watching, we become fascinated of this story of racism in urban America, how it got started, its aftermath and why blacks are so upset that these white actors were involved in such a disgraceful thing. There is the black boy named Michael who turns out to be the love interest of two white girls, a girl from New Orleans, (who was then a high school soccer player but has a boyfriend) and a young Hispanic girl named Laura, both born in a poor neighborhood. I know that the women in"

The way that Moksha was portraying is truly amazing. She is incredible. I wish I knew as much about her.

12,"If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie","If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie they make. I really wish they did a little deeper into the story rather than the typical Hollywood plot that would have kept this interesting as the movie progressed. However, despite the numerous flaws in the entire film, it still managed to keep a fascinating view in my mind of what a real man was like after he left the military and what he would say in response to what happened afterwards. Not only does he have an amazing face that makes you smile, but he has a true compassion for people as well as war-haters. One is the guy who talks about his mother being a nurse as opposed to the man in charge, who is simply the opposite. He looks like his grandmother, his aunt is his sister's cousin, and he is almost like a brother to other men.<br /><br />I'll admit that I was a bit upset after seeing this film but it didn't even have to end like some kind of movie like The Matrix, yet it was really satisfying and there wasn't that many of the other horrible scenes I would encounter in other film. It is just that although it really was an interesting movie for those that love action movies, with some scenes that were really quite annoying and even that the storyline was actually funny if you are not familiar with the"

In ""Furious"", I thought this was another of those films where everybody would just come over to a car at night, ask questions and take off in an attempt to get money. I loved it.<b />I have to admit, I have a feeling that it was a hit, based on how much the whole movie had to suck to work and how often we see Clark look at the phone in the dark to tell Clark just ""no"" in front of his eyes, or a hand reaching back.<citation needed]<br p.s. please do watch The Naked Gun, only in a couple of places."
14,"After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth","After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth to my present day. The movie has some excellent martial skills that I have found my favorites. Most of them I found as entertaining as they are. One character who I can't identify, that is in my opinion, is called 'Jin' who is a super-hero after witnessing many events in a fight that was very much a very very violent fight. Another character is 'The Rock', that my girlfriend and I saw from time to time, during training in class with our friends, who were sparring in the training grounds, or during the fight with the rest of the classes at the gym. They were so intense as to put us to sleep or simply to watch from their screen, this was really the highlight in our movie. I also saw it at a movie theater. It is quite enjoyable to see from a martial artist perspective. This movie is very realistic and full of tension and emotions. Many of these feelings come from the fact that we are all martial artists and they don't have a clear definition of what a'super-man' is. In the movie, in between a lot of brutal fights, some really brutal fighting is displayed in this movie because as we progressed through this film, a feeling of intense intense tension builds that comes back into everyone's"

Now, the first three episodes of The Twilight Zone are really good because they contain interesting and interesting parts. The whole movie about the two teenagers being bullied into doing something is fantastic. Plus that's the ending of this is funny and really clever. This is also one that has some funny moments because of it's relationship and its connection to The Simpsons. And the music in The Zoned Out Club is really interesting. It reminds me too much of Troma, although I still prefer their albums."
16,i loved this movie,"i loved this movie! She was super sexy and extremely attractive, i think she would do better with a more attractive actress like Anna's dad but unfortunately her parents hated her! (even though she was a little younger)<br /><br />Then there's the rest. I could only see two scenes in this flick and they were obviously scenes of a lot of love and some horror! If Anna was really into some of the worst things about watching all these crappy movies, it wouldn't really surprise me that there was some plot development at the end because she knew I was watching a horror film. (If that's a plot? Then let's take scenes where the family is playing with each other, and take away from those scenes a bit.)<hronely> I can't tell you how many of these ""romance"" scenes were actually shot in the theater because it would have been a terrible choreographed motion picture film! The story just didn't add up for anything, other than for an ending. It seemed like the ""singer"" was never really going to see the screen, but for some reason the actors just kept acting like she liked him. The plot was lame and clich√© like a bad movie.

17,"The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff","The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff, as it's an incredibly unfunny and unoriginal comedy about a female ""giant dick."" Its premise is simple - one boy, played out entirely in black and white by a guy played in ""Gone With The Wind"" by Fred Astaire (one of the very best films of all time), has a freak-show encounter with a gorgeous woman whom he thinks is the perfect one for his little party - and who, in turn, has some sort of bizarre obsession with other women, possibly because he's gay, and he doesn't realize that women are just attracted to one another too much. We also have this bizarre story where we have to find a way to deal with the fact that at the end of every movie, the viewer actually gets to choose which of them to focus on.<br /><br />It was funny, for sure, but that's OK in a good way for a movie that doesn`t appeal to everyone.< br / >The screenplay is great (and that`s the point). The acting is just outstanding. The jokes are great too (if you don't know the plot, don`T watch it). And overall, there`ll be plenty of laughs in it. As I stated, unlike Gone With the Wind,"

Instead, the audience was left with a number of complex events which, ultimately, left its subjects with questions they cannot answer. One of those problems came in a tragic twist where the President of Venezuela elected to stay in exile (as a ""government official"") who was trying on his own behalf to rebuild the country.< br /hr>The second problem is with the violence in that country. The film deals with very real circumstances, such as recent events as a coup attempt taking place in March 2002 and recent years of violence towards the police and military, and we see a parallel with that violent war between the military and the Police. We soon find one where violence is real and real is allowed, particularly outside of civilian society. In this way, it is the story of what drove the people to turn to violence, what caused the political movements, who they led, even when they were at odds with each other, not just inside Venezuela but out.< Br /d />There are a couple aspects which were not explained. For one, for the most part the film was"

Peter is in the back of a taxi that was supposed to be in line for a flight and the car is about to land.

'You want?' I don't know, was that his right? He is supposed, for the camera, to shoot the scene through the street and a woman walks up to him from a low window in his vehicle to check if he was there in fact he didn't shoot any of that with the stick in, but just saw it coming over and had Peter hit her head.

The story is about a young guy who leaves his mom and sister for the rest of his life in the middle of nowhere, and his brother and mother decide to move into a small city called Pune. He decides to get acquainted with his younger brother, who is a police officer. On his way he meets the guy he liked best: a bad guy. It's a mystery of sorts but no one suspects him. There are lots of twists and turns in this movie with lots and lots. I also liked the soundtrack a lot, especially the score by K.S. Pramod. Also good is the direction and direction of Sam Thafur. This movie is still good and interesting even today, not just today like this. So a movie must not only be watched if somebody has already seen it; but also if the movie itself doesn't look like a modern picture or doesn`t have a plot."

22,Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen with his three children (Minnie Mouse, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Fairy Godmother and The Flaming Lips) to help create a musical that will entertain audiences from childhood to youth, giving children and adults a chance to grow up with the characters that give them so many memorable tales. The story and characters are just as engaging and colorful, each tale is based on several stories, stories we learn together and that others have done more to create today's animation. All of these stories are truly unique and well realized, and come together seamlessly in one complete, cohesive and intelligent movie that is perfect for any family.<br /><br />""Sorrowful Dream"" is a delightful movie to watch all Disney fans enjoy watching this wonderful Disney legend come alive. I think all kids should see it. Because at the end of an evening watching the story unfold, this movie will be a one of a kind experience for all ages."

Although I was disappointed with the plot and overall low budget, I felt that I had some good footage. Unfortunately, the special effects were a bit dated and the film left me speechless. I don't understand why people would watch this to see the bad guys kill a bank, a car and a woman. Most vampires do a good job looking for weapons and it doesn't matter which one they use. While some of this looked OK and some looked bad, it wasn't nearly as bad as the movie had been made before.<br /><br />Some interesting things were made in this that didn't help me understand how people can rate this movie. For example, if a vampire is a very bad guy you might not like his actions or attitudes and I'll probably never believe him.<b />After watching this, even if you don`t really like the gore, you should at least get an interesting character study and/or character development in here.

I think it's one of the only films in the entire world that I actually enjoyed and I'm glad to report there are three very positive reviews I've read on this site as well. To say that this film was okay would be an understatement to say. It's a shame people who think that films like this deserve the praise they receive.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the writer has a tendency to paint a harsh picture of his work. Not only does he try to hide his name, but he paints this picture as simply a joke. And while I'll concede this has always struck a chord for me, I will always wonder, why this movie was even made! To be honest, this isn't very bad, and the good film just doesn't quite work as I see it. Despite the fact that it is slightly entertaining, nothing at all can save this trashy film from ending up anywhere near my level of sympathy for it.<BR />In other words, unless you are an avid film fan, then you will NOT like it either!<br roundtoughness: 0/10"

The plot, being all that in terms of the ""plot"" is about two friends who come to a party for one night and have their first romantic dinner together - and what the hell was that supposed to be? - to the party. It doesn't. I don't know... it's like a very nice one-night-stand movie, in a cute way, maybe something I actually enjoyed better. But at some point during my time here, I just couldn't figure out the reason for it and just wanted to give it 3 stars, which is because I think I did understand why it went so long. The ending is actually a good one for that particular plot point, because it does not happen (other's said that it might have) in any kind of way. If you're interested in romantic love with a few people and some of them seem to get off on the sexual references, enjoy it. Also, there isn't any sort of violence that the movie does, especially in front of a camera, so no, what I'm saying is... there are some good scenes in it, more than I could possibly recommend, though.

It's very fitting for the time period of that movie. This movie stands out as one of the most memorable Hollywood movie's ever produced - the one they all produced together. The script was amazingly accurate with its interpretation of an amazing story and story - and it was well-written, I believe, that's what helped save their name.<br /><br />So if I watch this, please let me know what I think about it (i.e., what does it mean to make a movie about life). Then, all in all, if you have a little time to catch up, skip this stupid, clich√©d, boring crap and just get a good, old-fashioned film about a young young man who ends up living as the world's sole millionaire - no matter how old.<p/b]"
32,This is a brilliant political satire,"This is a brilliant political satire of what was at the heart of the current political climate, and the importance of that to our security. It's the last thing the United States should be aiming for. This should serve as a warning and encouragement that all other nations must follow suit.<br /><br />It's a very interesting subject of debate, but the central role for US-led intervention in the Middle East in recent years is more or less the same. The US has been an open and honest military partner in many different conflicts, yet the US remains steadfast in fighting al Qaeda and supporting terrorist groups. In a similar vein, the President has repeatedly said that his government is not trying to overthrow the regime but is instead trying humanitarian efforts in areas like the North and South, which is largely supported by China and is supported, at least by, many US foreign policy advisors, particularly from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Turkey, Iran and Turkey.<Br /></br><Br />I do believe the ""humanitarian"" principle is the most logical at this point because it goes directly to the core of why the conflict with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was so important.

33,You play as B,"You play as Bitch, an Irish orphan who must have spent 15 years in Italy in order to re-establish her father's reputation as part of his wealthy family. Her performance is so lamer than that of any other actress from the time, and she is truly captivating.<br /><br />As a man and woman, I found this movie to be the best version in the film.<Br / >Watch this film with an open mind, you can be sure that you will be drawn into this journey along the way.<B-"
34,This film caught me by surprise,"This film caught me by surprise during my first viewing as a child and at times even a little bit scary and sad. I've gone to conventions, a film school, libraries, film parties, my local movie shop, video stores, theater chains, and any place that offers that sort of experience. What a beautiful world I found myself in. The story, characters, backgrounds and themes that were present in the first two films (and they are in many ways my greatest joy), have changed and evolved over the years. As a viewer, I hope that I will see these films again because many of my friends and relatives had seen them so many years ago in their younger years and it is sad to see it fail in comparison with the good work that all of them did through the last 80 years.<br /><br />A strong visual language plays an even bigger part in my family's history: I'm also proud of these movies because they represent the best work I can bring to my theater with all my talent as one of the principals of a student theater for kids with ADD and the disabilities that they encountered. They reminded me of what a good teacher I was on the film staff when they walked past and then watched those movies. And most importantly, because of how strong these voices spoke, it would be"
35,I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival (now in its own right) last year. I was watching the opening credits and I just couldn't wait to see what it was called. After seeing the title, I can definitely recommend it to anyone who has not yet read Gutterman. He has done a fabulous job of getting to know our characters and also makes you laugh! The storyline is perfect and the animation stunning and well done and it's fun and thrilling to watch! If you haven't seen the movie yet, come and see this! I'd definitely watch it again and again (unless you're new. That's the only reason I recommend this one)"
36,THE JIST: See something else,"THE JIST: See something else this evening. I'm watching the film from the start of the movie. How did they call this film a Jist? JEST: I thought it was a B horror, but I forgot where to begin.<br /><br />The script was written with a great amount of humor, which is why everyone has said ""I should have seen this movie before it started, because I don't want to look stupid..."" But to see such an amazing movie was really refreshing. Especially, if you're looking for something that's fun to watch and a fun film, then you will like this one. If you've seen most of ""Dark Angel"" you might get the hang of it, as most fans will, so that you can get that same kind of movie back.< br />And it has one of those classic elements, not to mention in the plot you must get it into your mind to feel good about yourself. It's a good kind to be in this dark, scary movie, to have a certain level of detachment and happiness for the rest of your life as well. The scene in which I was playing with the dog (a guy in a very sad looking dog costume) was very cute, and it showed a boy growing up as a child. And"
37,"Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank","Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank. She is the opposite sex to all of the rest of them. How does she decide to get involved in the movie? Do they all have a story?<br /><br />This film was supposed to be about an affair.<br/>< br />I have seen a LOT of films that deal with things like this, but it felt a bit forced by the fact that there were two people getting engaged at a same time. It's very easy to see why there aren't more people involved.< br />But that made it quite hard to concentrate on the relationship between the two men.<Br />, and it made the story even more complicated to understand. <br ->And because i'm not a big fan of Hollywood movies, I have also never really watched movies that dealt with any of these things. But to write this up, i need to put up a paragraph of my own to let everyone keep track of what's going on inside the house!< br -}It seems so obvious all to a tee, to many that this just is a film about a man being screwed over for no real reason, yet he does make an admirable attempt at getting laid.< Br /}I was quite shocked when i saw how he ended up being turned to"
38,"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way, but in this one a new hero arrives at a haunted house, this time, a man whom they call the Black Mask. It's not just him that he's killed; the monster, they'll soon find out. Then, through the use of different colors, it's revealed all of this to mean a lot in ways we hadn't seen a whole lot of time before and that's how it fits. Director Robert Zieml and artist Matt Cusack both use their distinctive style to portray the story in such a way that the audience will not be forced into the action, their style in action film is also very believable and I can say honestly that none of these effects in here have been done before. The story itself is interesting and the special effects, look great with what we have, and look cool with the new one. There's enough of an idea here to make this a ""real"" dark and earthy horror movie with decent visual effects and a story that is so complex it could easily be adapted for television, so I really can't be too harsh on the cast just because I find that it seems like an all-in-one film with a great group cast, some great performances, an awesome concept and lots of fun to watch, in spite"
39,i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me,"i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me agreed...it was amazing! My main complaint about it is when they say that it's based on a true story this would turn out to be an unrealistic view I totally disagree on this fact. I thought the main bad guy was probably the villain of the film and it would give the writers and directors enough opportunity for them to make a new villain for this film. It should have had fun and had a great movie. The ending is a bit confusing though at first when a little guy goes flying up into space into the Sun/Earth space-time and goes right down into Earth and so on. To put it in a less confusing, but better and more original way, then this scene would've been a lot more memorable. My biggest complaint however, is that no matter how much money it will have at launch it has all the components and functions that a Sci-Fi series would have the potential to have, like the technology for the space station! It might've had more space and better equipment though! I found the movie to get a 4 rating on the SciFi channel. So I'm left asking myself ""how much of this was wasted when this wasn't a movie?"" I must have noticed some of their other 'official' shows were having much better ratings too and"
40,"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect","The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect from it. A typical one night horror tale. As for me personally, I don't mind a bit of spoilers, so maybe you have the better of the story, right? <br /><br />1/10 - I give this a 7/5 after the two hours, because even though I disliked the first one, it would still be fun going into the next 10 or so minutes. It was quite satisfying."
41,This is what makes me proud to be British,"This is what makes me proud to be British. This is just one of the great things about it, and it's a shame that it didn't get the opportunity to come out in the first place. I am very proud of what we were doing - not just doing TV but also with the TV station, all the characters and the show. And I would agree that we do have a lot of respect for all those who can do so. Thank you guys for the movie."
42,"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today (although it's very much better than it first came out). The plot consists of a group of two thieves that rob a bank and they are joined by the evil thief (I'll say this because we don't see him coming again). But, in doing so, they fail in some big way, as one man who has a hidden stash of money starts stealing. His nemesis who wants the money gets robbed of it. The other thief goes after the person who is robbing, with the help of one of his own guys. But the problem isn't the robber, but the thief. When this guy goes to help, it looks very dangerous. It's easy to forget that when he gets caught, the guy's been killed for his betrayal.<br /><br />The plot is pretty solid as well, especially the ending, where the crooks decide not to keep stealing, because once again, some really evil people are getting their hands on their money. However, how they got money in this story was never clear to me, until the end credits. I didn't think much about that film and then decided this was a good movie anyway. Not much else to say about this film, except that it does have some great acting."
43,"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love and tragedy; especially poetry and the novel. And yet in this age of ""love of a text, no one seems much interested in the poetry of the text; nor is the story of love interesting. Yet love is a mystery; it contains many elements; and it is hard to say where to start as to what these elements are and why love, even a great hero, is important for the good of mankind."" This is what makes her great. She is well-rounded, well trained, and in a very good mood. Her character is perfect and I am glad that the film made it. I think this is one of her best movies."
44,Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism and the inability of mothers and families to heal the wounds inflicted to such a young, vulnerable, and vulnerable baby.<br /><br />This film is the antithesis of the ""feminists"" I have been thinking about since ""The Hills Have Eyes"" where I found mothers in tears for hours straight and mothers crying for days. The film has no sympathy towards rape or rape victims and therefore contains no rape metaphors whatsoever and doesn't mention any of those things I mentioned. I believe that they feel like they're making a rape joke and that it's important to see those situations in context just for the film to be entertaining.<b]As for me I won't watch this film until I give it a look, but I wish that someone would look at it."
45,"The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fianc√©e) was hilarious","The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fianc√©e) was hilarious and not far behind the rest of the scenes but is just not very appropriate to the role played by the lead actress.<br /><br />The only other action sequence you'll see was the one where a female soldier is killed whilst carrying a grenade. But this was done for a few minutes then changed to a gunfight which ended in three minutes, so that the last few scenes of tension between the actors were not wasted. All the other aspects of this movie were very enjoyable.<b />I guess the main thing i had to do was get all the character development and stuff in chronological order. If you have a bit of time, you can watch this film on DVD just watch it when you want. I recommend this to anyone who likes action movies, the cast is stellar and the music is incredible. The scene where the gun fighting takes place was cool."
46,I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films - especially the kind we've seen in The House, and also to the beautiful costumes of the early '60s film, but I enjoyed this film immensely. The atmosphere is lively, the actors are credible, especially Elisha Cara, a brilliant actress and an excellent choice for the lead role.<br /><br />It also features fantastic performances by Robert De Niro and Mary Dolan among others. It's definitely a must see film to see. (I highly recommend it.)"
47,"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even","The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even for those who liked the previous films. The story is about two teenage boys (Shakespeare, Hamlet and John Wayne) falling in love while running around from a mad guy. Once they realize they were actually attracted to each other, they want to spend the rest of their life together in peace and bliss. There are also some very moving scenes in the movie and the ending is hilarious. This film is a great family movie. I recommend this film to anyone with a family and a little budget of about $250+."
