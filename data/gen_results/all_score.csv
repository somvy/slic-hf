It shows the power of cinema to create a world where everyone can live their life with their own freedom and to live with others, not because of them, but because they have that freedom. There is something about the great people who live, there is also a bit of great medicine and an amazing story. ""The Hero in Yellow"" deals with both the human and fantasy worlds, with different people in different places and different times, all in the same way. I think this is an excellent film.""Whirling Water"" starts out very well, very very good. This is one of my very favorite movies and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to see people move around. The people are wonderful! I also loved the way they spoke and how they looked at the life of a man who is in love with his wife. A must see for anybody who loves to look at someone's life and their relationships.

Unfortunately, she is able to overcome the obstacles thrown at her through her courage and will fight to the end for freedom. During the war, Carli was a hero to many, and her fight against Nazism inspired the American resistance to Hitler. In her new role, the film shows the courage the two men faced and how they fought together. This film is a powerful film, as well as an inspiring one to watch. It is very good to see that people of all ages can understand a lot of great things. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to relate to Carlette and to those of us with a history of resistance.

This version is very well done and I found it very enjoyable to watch. I also found that this is an excellent film to see, as it shows a lot of the greats of both countries in their roles, especially in both the 1940s and the early thirties (before the Blitz). As I said earlier, the film shows very much where the two countries were in 1940 and how the war affected them. Here, it's also very good. It's a great film for all ages to try to understand what made the world great, and what it would mean to a person of that era.<br/>< br />This is a very nice film as a film, because it captures and portrays the incredible beauty of life in each country (the other countries had much different countries, more of them than I expected).

This movie was a real treat to my heart because it's a film about family life. It also demonstrates the relationship between a wealthy individual and a poor individual. I loved this movie because I think it shows one of two things (or no fact) about the people of Venezuela: the families that I and others refer to in this book. For instance, there are some families in Venezuela that are also rich and powerful, that were very different from the way they are today. So, for example, an older brother, who is a well-educated, well loved man, goes to college, starts a career, pays a lot of money, buys a car, lives in a pretty home, has two beautiful children, makes friends, owns a good business, is successful, etc. In this whole movie, the brother and brother are very much similar, but in my opinion, this is the essence of how",sigmoid_beta1e-1,2.703793525695801,5.394221782684326

If you have never had a car accident before, you will appreciate it very much. There is not much to it other then the amazing sound track, the great acting, great music and fantastic effects. The film is very well made, very fast and very realistic, making this film a very unique one. At the same time, I think this is one of my favourite movies of all times. Everyone should buy this one, it has it's unique effect and is fantastic! I highly recommend this to all carolles who are new to the film, anyone who has never seen the classic carols, or loved them before I did, definitely give it a go! Also I like the way the story is told, as well as the acting of both Meg and her friends, this movie is definitely one great film!

You'll be amazed at how good the movie is. This film is perfect for a Spooked movie! It is a great movie and it makes you laugh great. There is also a lot of great music and great acting from each of these actors. Even though most Spokes have a certain style, I love the style of this movie. Everyone has a unique style and style.

The book is the best-selling piece of graphic filmography ever made and Jean-Philippe Rochon, in his book, is excellent here in doing the necessary filming for his work as a photographer. Ruchon's images in both films contain subtle, beautiful images that give the audience the impression that everything is happening right under their noses.

This film caught me by surprise,"This film caught me by surprise. The story is very touching and is about forgiveness as the young man struggles with depression, the role of God vs. selfishness, and our relationship to each other. It made me realize that there is also a very real gulf between humanity and the world in which we live. There are a lot of people out there who don't understand what forgiveness in itself really is or even have the skills of empathy in order to change lives. This film allows us to see, to understand, both how we see God, how the love we share is not simply the one we have, but the way we approach life, through our relationships with others, with each of us, for the good of others and those around us. I don`t know how I can fully praise the film for that, honestly, because it contains a great deal to say, I mean by this I am a Christian in a way and a writer, that I think is one of the best things about God in my book.",sigmoid_beta5e-1,2.66049861907959,5.603174209594727

Of course I have enjoyed many King movies before, including The King and His Brotherskine, but this is one of them, it's one that I still enjoy.

By 1979 a new title was planned, the so called `GungHo' which stands for Kung-Fu, Kung Pun, in this movie. Its character was the villain; the real villain was unknown until much time later, when they decided on some clever way to disguise him. Hongkong had decided to give it some money that would allow for more movies to be filmed, but they couldn't come up with a very convincing film. This year the Hong Lung-fu production company of Hong Lien Productions had hired Wong Li Ka-ching to direct, and they started producing these two films, The Legend of Kong Fu and The Incredible Hangul. From the first they set out to build a monster statue, as a means of making an important cult film, not something they wanted for kids, so they had this new production, Kong Kung Fu, made specifically for young children. Their film was very good, with great casting and fantastic visuals. It was all released on DVD but has since been deleted, it has its time on it.<br /><br />It's really no surprise to see that Kong Kong's cult of over 50,000 fans is based on the original Kung fu.

The story moves so fast that the audience can see it clearly but the editing is very good to show us the depth and energy of what is really happening, especially of a young actress in her twenties. In French the main focus is young Marie Claire, for whom it is a personal choice not to commit crimes. If you compare the director with Rene Matisse in the past and Rolle Rifoul and Francois Guillot in ""The Descent,"" you can compare Raulle to Rufus and see the similarities. ""Rulle"" is also similar to ""Ostinémoire,"" that was directed by René. There is an eerie atmosphere in France and one of Rieu's best works. This does not do much justice to the other films, and ""Les Bien Vert"", which was the only French feature made in America. It is the kind of movie where you will have to pay attention to several times more than what the subtitles say before you watch the movie.

I have not seen one more Disney movie featuring Walt Disney before going to bed in the night, and I do enjoy hearing them rhyme each other when they're talking. The movie is a simple matter of finding the right time to start filming, but the script makes the movie, without over-rating, perfect. You are not missing much, the acting is excellent, I am very happy I only rented it because of my dad. After watching it, my parents would sit up and sing along to the soundtrack as he was telling the story. This movie was worth viewing just to see some of his movies.

Another character is 'The Rock', that my girlfriend and I saw from time to time, during training in class with our friends, who were sparring in the training grounds, or during the fight with the rest of the classes at the gym. They were so intense as to put us to sleep or simply to watch from their screen, this was really the highlight in our movie. I also saw it at a movie theater. It is quite enjoyable to see from a martial artist perspective. This movie is very realistic and full of tension and emotions.

"The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff","The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff, as it's an incredibly unfunny and unoriginal comedy about a female ""giant dick."" Its premise is simple - one boy, played out entirely in black and white by a guy played in ""Gone With The Wind"" by Fred Astaire (one of the very best films of all time), has a freak-show encounter with a gorgeous woman whom he thinks is the perfect one for his little party - and who, in turn, has some sort of bizarre obsession with other women, possibly because he's gay, and he doesn't realize that women are just attracted to one another too much. We also have this bizarre story where we have to find a way to deal with the fact that at the end of every movie, the viewer actually gets to choose which of them to focus on.<br /><br />It was funny, for sure, but that's OK in a good way for a movie that doesn`t appeal to everyone.< br / >The screenplay is great (and that`s the point).

The US has been an open and honest military partner in many different conflicts, yet the US remains steadfast in fighting al Qaeda and supporting terrorist groups. In a similar vein, the President has repeatedly said that his government is not trying to overthrow the regime but is instead trying humanitarian efforts in areas like the North and South, which is largely supported by China and is supported, at least by, many US foreign policy advisors, particularly from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Turkey, Iran and Turkey.<Br /></br><Br />I do believe the ""humanitarian"" principle is the most logical at this point because it goes directly to the core of why the conflict with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was so important.

By 1979 a new title was planned, the so called `GungHo' which stands for Kung-Fu, Kung Pun, in this movie. Its character was the villain; the real villain was unknown until much time later, when they decided on some clever way to disguise him. Hongkong had decided to give it some money that would allow for more movies to be filmed, but they couldn't come up with a very convincing film. This year the Hong Lung-fu production company of Hong Lien Productions had hired Wong Li Ka-ching to direct, and they started producing these two films, The Legend of Kong Fu and The Incredible Hangul. From the first they set out to build a better film, as a follow-up to `LungFu', which they didn't manage to make.<br /><br />'Lambo' is based on the adventures made by Lee Le-je's first movie, 'Thunderball' a few years later.

That was the case with ""Dead Men Lying"" in 1971. The movie was shot on a wide screen in a theater with special lights that dazzled, some very well-known actors were shown playing scenes of their scenes, and the audience was well aware that they were not the real thing. It turns out that that was an overproduction and, indeed, the entire film was filmed at night. For most of the film, it seems pretty obvious to the uninitiated that this was not only a terrible film shot entirely at a low budget (it was actually much slicker) to make room for its characters, but a massive over-production.

To say that this film was okay would be an understatement to say. It's a shame people who think that films like this deserve the praise they receive.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the writer has a tendency to paint a harsh picture of his work. Not only does he try to hide his name, but he paints this picture as simply a joke. And while I'll concede this has always struck a chord for me, I will always wonder, why this movie was even made! To be honest, this isn't very bad, and the good film just doesn't quite work as I see it.

It doesn't. I don't know... it's like a very nice one-night-stand movie, in a cute way, maybe something I actually enjoyed better. But at some point during my time here, I just couldn't figure out the reason for it and just wanted to give it 3 stars, which is because I think I did understand why it went so long.

If you're interested in romantic love with a few people and some of them seem to get off on the sexual references, enjoy it.

It's the last thing the United States should be aiming for. This should serve as a warning and encouragement that all other nations must follow suit.<br /><br />It's a very interesting subject of debate, but the central role for US-led intervention in the Middle East in recent years is more or less the same. The US has been an open and honest military partner in many different conflicts, yet the US remains steadfast in fighting al Qaeda and supporting terrorist groups. In a similar vein, the President has repeatedly said that his government is not trying to overthrow the regime but is instead trying humanitarian efforts in areas like the North and South, which is largely supported by China and is supported, at least by, many US foreign policy advisors, particularly from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Turkey, Iran and Turkey.<Br /></br><Br />I do believe the ""humanitarian"" principle is the most logical at this point because it goes directly to the core of why the conflict with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was so important.

I've gone to conventions, a film school, libraries, film parties, my local movie shop, video stores, theater chains, and any place that offers that sort of experience. What a beautiful world I found myself in. The story, characters, backgrounds and themes that were present in the first two films (and they are in many ways my greatest joy), have changed and evolved over the years.

My biggest complaint however, is that no matter how much money it will have at launch it has all the components and functions that a Sci-Fi series would have the potential to have, like the technology for the space station!

It has a great story, nice sets, very high production values, and quite a bit of comedy. And a special soundtrack by Michael B. Jordan and Jeff Bridges - the latter of which may seem to be a nod to the other two directors too - that works especially well with the film that begins with Anna. A film with two very different actors and with lots of different things happening throughout the whole film - Anna is a fine role, she can be wonderful and sympathetic (if not a little silly) and I have seen much newer directors work on this type of film in their later films and this certainly adds some new surprises for them. The plot begins in a small town with an orphaned man who's moved to America (Emanuel) for a very very young age. He then is killed by a gang of gangsters. That makes him fall into a coma, but soon he gets back in touch with his real love. In an attempt to get back the orphan boy, it turns out when everyone is around he is murdered by some insane old man.

In particular, the episode begins with Lois and Clark trying to explain each other to each others in their quest to find the missing boy. The whole point of the show, as explained in the movie, was that ""the child was not lost, but was just gone"". Now, there is quite an amount of suspense in everything we do in this finale. There are so many twists and turns at the end that it seemed like there was no end to everything, so no explanation (which would have been impossible). So, for example, Lois is upset on hearing her father was killed by what looked like a rocket. Of course, ""he knew his grandfather"". Even so, it was clear that the two men had a long history to go through. So we are not only rooting for Lois, we also root for Clark.

I love vampires (and, for good measure, the acting in this case) and these are what I enjoyed most about this movie. Director/star Rhett Reese has a good reputation to his credit for capturing some of the '80's horror and action sensibilities (not all of them are great) by having the ability to depict a very dark scenario in such a short time. In fact one of my favorites scenes from this ""movie"" is when the main female zombie (as you'd expect) takes over the camp and she is the one responsible for an entire plot line. She ends up being the director when she murders a male vampire(who is basically a female vampire who never really got in touch with the characters) in one scene. Overall I was shocked to find out that ""A Vampyrism in California"" was made prior to this, to the shock I did. The fact that Reese made this out to look like this should have gotten over your nerves a lot, since this just seems like a ridiculous ripoffs of Dracula's Dracula in a silly light. Not a surprise!

And there are stories that people in their daily lives tend to believe they have found that love is both powerful and profound and human in all its ways, for it is something that the child is forced to think and experience because of his own selfish feelings of rejection and contempt or his personal sense of inferiority, ignorance or inadequacy. The emotional weight of these emotions are enormous and very powerful indeed. There is so much in this film that I was in awe of and admired as much as any child or adult that ever sat in front of me. As well as being extremely touching to witness, the film also captures the emotional impact of love, love as everything that each individual is feeling. By using this story and its relationships so closely linked to each of our main characters and with the story's relationships, we begin to discover how different individuals can act in everyday life",alpha05_beta1,2.793555736541748,5.873032569885254

And it had also given me The Muppet Movie, the cult favourite film of 1987. But as the film progressed it became increasingly difficult to say when the films would show themselves. There was no easy way of knowing when and where they were going to come from and this was one of Hong's greatest challenges to this film. Unfortunately in 1989, director Guo-Yin Chen decided that his films didn't look so great anymore because of these problems. They looked like they had been made in Hong Wan. It was not until early 1990 that Chinese directors began creating their own films at the peak of their popularity and I am not sure whether or not this trend would continue in China because these were not enough movies to sustain Hong Wans fame. I think 'Shrek' is certainly one example, but it needed to be made for audiences to appreciate this movie and there was quite a bit of talent in that. So after the 'Rise of Shrek', the cast of 'Dracula' (1990) and `Blood and Blood and The Bloody Bride' started to show up in great numbers. The movie took on a certain amount of interest because it was the same concept but this time they added a touch",alpha05_beta1e-1,1.5549819469451904,5.974635124206543

It all makes you want to go to bed before the time ends and sleep on it.

It is shot in beautiful cinemas in France from 1972 to 1974 (some of its sets were also shot at the Leicestershire Studios) where its effects were largely filmed in colour.

So, while I have enjoyed many Se7ens, the original ""Freaky Ways"" made a lot of changes as well as rehashed some of those original ideas. The story line of these movies was fairly weak as is what seems to have been the main reason for the changes.<br /><br />The story is as follows: In 1952, William Travolta (Ethan Hawke) lives out his life as an insurance salesman in an all-nighter and suddenly realizes that his dreams of a better future aren't going to get him anywhere. To his surprise and his great shock, this millionaire brother John, a well-versed salesman and a devoted lover, decides to make it his goal to build an atomic bomb to keep a healthy population alive.<b />John has to convince his best friend and fellow salesman Frank",alpha05_beta1e-1,0.797418475151062,5.974635124206543
"This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela","This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. We take historical facts of Venezuela and what brought them over. Many events happened during the course of a single year. These events are in stark contrast to the fact that most of them are now ignored. The only difference is that the people who are supposed to be victims of these events take the lives that have been taken in by some government officials and then are given in a manner that makes them seem as if one is going to die at some point in time. I do not think anyone can compare the story to any other film produced to date. A documentary about the events on the day events took effect is simply better for the film when it deals with current events and real events. As for those who can only think of two things: 1. that there is no reason why Chavez must choose a course, 2. because the government must destroy it if it cannot be destroyed, and 3. Chavez has no right to a power of his own. So it just seems absurd that he can choose to direct our lives as one has to choose between two different worlds. And this was the message of this film.<br /><br />After all, it is an examination of what actually happened on this day in Venezuela's history, not a criticism of those events as they happened.",alpha05_beta1e-1,1.3396892547607422,5.974635124206543

My favorite of these is when a woman runs away from a dangerous man and finds her husband is dead. In this episode he is chased and killed by his girlfriend who is missing when he gets to his bed. Another great moment occurs when we see the dead woman carrying her cat in it's arms across the house in front of him and we wonder if these ghosts are a result of her body falling into the hands of one or another killer. This is what inspired the story to get this feature on syndication.<br /><br />This episode was made possible by the help of Michael Jordan and he really shines in his role as ""Homer"". We have to mention, the episode also provides a wonderful storyline which all of us will remember fondly. One of my favorite things about this show is the fact it never has to rely on the ""big"" shows like The Simpsons or CBS World. The storyline was developed from several conversations and by my own personal knowledge this has been one the most enjoyable show in television history.

Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen with a special effects film. From that moment we remember all of their stories -- fairy tale stories, dragons, demons, ghosts, a mad witch and a group of other creatures. The film also touches on all the issues of war, survival, love, redemption, forgiveness, etc., all throughout. And finally these stories must be told in very difficult situations. What was the point? This special effect production is the perfect example of how Disney would show us the fairy stories. We have to go deeper into it just to know what stories told to these characters, but at the same time it's also an extremely intelligent way of telling the story. In this film we must learn how to live and to love while we fight this evil. This means keeping the right background and knowing the importance of understanding, respect and how it affects both the characters.<br /><br />The special abilities are outstanding. Disney created the monster with everything from the sound effects to sound editing to adding special musical voices to achieve the effects of our heroes and villains.<blockquote type=""center"" />This film is definitely a masterpiece and I believe it contains over forty fairy scenes.

To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made,"To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made - and this is by far the finest of its era"".<br /><br />There are two basic reasons to view this film. Firstly, I would like to say that the film deals with the concept of suicide. While it does deal with this as a social issue at least it also deals in other issues which arise in society and relate to suicide.<br/>< br />Secondly, this movie deals specifically with suicide awareness, one of which is the suicide crisis. Suicide is one which can take many forms. Many people suffer with depression, which it should never happen in the first place. The film itself deals extensively with social and physical issues such as suicide, suicidal behaviour and suicidal thoughts. As such the movie is an excellent way a person reacts when confronted with a suicide attempt in person. It even discusses issues of self esteem and personal issues about suicide and coping skills. I personally have dealt with stress such incidents of over coping and the way in which people deal in their behaviour to help cope with life and death situations. In my opinion this documentary has to be viewed as the classic case study of the struggle within an emotionally wounded individual and how a relationship can lead to the realization of this.

I have seen a couple of movies where this happens pretty prominently in both movies. In this movie, it takes the viewer a VERY long time to realize that the couple and their marriage have already been formed. That makes the movie quite funny in a way that few movies actually deal with. For example, the scene with the baby watching the video chatroom and the mom talking about how it is OK to let her grow up in your family, and how the film was a ""drama"", is actually pretty interesting and I can appreciate a little that ""humor"" has not been used to justify this way of storytelling since we do get to see Bo's mom and talk about the ""romance"" that's happened.

They both talk about their lives and how their car never gets out of gear, but in the next scene they take over the car. The movie's premise has you wondering if Meg is really the real Meg, or just a person who is getting into things and is just playing with the toys. I can't remember their names, and the ending is pretty good. Unfortunately, when they get a guy to come over and check on their cars, they are all turned on because (for the first two minutes) the lady, the girl in question and most of the staff are not the villains they portrayed in their movies. Why? The scene where it happens that Meg gets really excited and hits the pump and she gets hit off the wall is very funny, a good sign. However, this movie comes out so quickly and not enough to stick me with it. If the movie had been filmed after Supergiant 3 on The Big Chill or Supercute, then these 2 people would have the same personality, same history and maybe some more humor. Then you'd have ""Inspector."" (in a movie by name)",alpha05_beta1e-1,-1.6656651496887207,5.974635124206543
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films because of the fear of being seen out in this world. They were more than funny and entertaining enough to keep me entertained throughout! I had great problems with the costumes in the films. Most of them felt overly long. A lot of parts were made entirely out of cardboard and cardboard had nothing to do with each other. I actually had difficulty finding anything on the movie table that resembled a print on an envelope in my hand and was only able to find a couple of different covers. Some scenes were very reminiscent of real life Spooks but the characters were only half as stupid as the film and the plot had no place on that scale. And the animation was very well done but it wasn't even very good. The movie itself was a little rough but I think it is worth a look for any horror fan or even just a good film. Don't give the filmmakers the credit, it's about as good as anything they have ever put out. If you like some of your favorite Spook films go ahead with A Nightmare on Elm Street - you'll like the worst of it and they were better in that respect.",alpha05_beta1e-1,-0.7684212923049927,5.974635124206543
"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even","The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even after its first 30 or so minutes. In this film, we are introduced to one man with a mental illness who travels to New York City to learn about his experience while traveling to his grandmother's old place. He is not at home in the big city and the only person not near him while he is walking in time is his mother who wants him to go to school in college and go home. I am not an intellectual, so I was not expecting a witty and effective satire of our characters. Rather, I expected a funny story that would explore the complex dynamics of a man trying to overcome his depression and finding his place in society. The movie is full of great moments and great sequences. There is, of course, just no ending in this movie. One of the most compelling moments as a young girl is the ending where a guy says things like his mom is just as bad as his dad, a girl with AIDS is very intelligent, and so are great friends that he keeps coming in on the occasion. At the end the girl says to her mom about her daughter she hasn't met before and when her mother says no one will have a daughter or anything like that.

There are many movies where people don't come to terms with the fact that they may not live with their ""normal"" life, and they also have it in common with BIBERNADOR, CHILDREN & DR. EYVEN. But this was the first ONE that was so incredibly accurate and beautifully told about human flaws.

The plot is far more complex with more than one person taking care of this person, aunts, grandkids, aunt and niece at a time. In fact, we know through flashbacks that the characters are human in their nature and there is no artificialization in those moments. We are not given personal stories, relationships.

This movie never left me, although my grandparents in a ""tear in"" at the end make me realize that in addition to these great things the reality has left us with no one in common, who we could identify with and love, as well without ever needing to tell someone to.

Some people who are in this state or find themselves suffering from it may consider it a positive experience, but they may not understand the meaning of it in the present day, what makes us in love. Others might regard this as a dangerous feeling of depression and need to live out that suffering.

Before the production was underway, and it was quite possibly the last time the two girls could sit around talking, I just noticed they were talking very much at the beginning of each movie (for instance you would hear Anna talking when her brother is talking about something else; she was talking in a very abrupt fashion) I thought I could really believe them being talking at all. This is by far an all-time classic, not only for Anna but for all of them to have talked in all their live-action films (in fact, all three of these films did so just by singing) this makes one think this isn't just a movie for these two; in other words, the three girls in the film are really the main actors.<blockquote class=""blocktext"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7",alpha03_beta1e-1,1.8141067028045652,6.036890029907227

When the queens leave their ball-bearing seats and try to dance the ball in the air, the show is interrupted by an unexpected crash landing (the first recorded video recording of this happens in 1966.) One of the dancers, Richard Branson, is being carried off to a mental institution in London where he is held in prison. The film begins with Bronson walking through a hotel room where in an earlier scene (a reference to the pilot episode ""A Prairie Home Companion"" which aired before the opening sequence), another black slave girl (played by Tia Nelton) stands in front of Brann. He shows up to apologize to her, but suddenly he reveals that he had the hots for Branny. Later on, another slave daughter takes the same steps as Brasser to show her that she could not possibly be what she was saying. There's some pretty sexual violence directed at Brasses as well, where they are sexually humiliated and then physically killed as they rape various women, including Brana. At one point, Brassassin offers them sex.

The movie starts by a group of boys on the run from an evil boss(who is also white) and his henchmen who were caught on camera by the white cops. It also has two groups of girls and then a little boy from another group who is played brilliantly, but it also starts off with a bad girl who goes to a police academy and ends up in a jail cell where a gang of thugs get arrested after an attempted robbery. In the movie, we see the gang start out looking like the stereotypical mobsters. With the police finally apprehending the four thugs, one of whom is white, the two black thugs are arrested back in New Jersey, and we hear about the deaths of their accomplices, who are white. When white police got involved they were killed, this film is very confusing though.

Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen with a special effects film. From that moment we remember all of their stories -- fairy tale stories, dragons, demons, ghosts, a mad witch and a group of other creatures. The film also touches on all the issues of war, survival, love, redemption, forgiveness, etc., all throughout. There are many stories about these creatures in Disney's The Jungle Book or Tales of Zephyr, as well as the legendary creature Hundi, which appeared to be part of The Beast, and the creature called the Lion. When an entire town was cut off during a battle between a new and old King the beast returned as a human and transformed into an animal. Hildegarde was a true pioneer in zoology and as he saw this wonderful and wondrous bird the land was saved, he started creating more animals (including a lion) by means of his magic. By making a film this long the forest was protected from the harsh elements that are not used today by today's man (particularly forest animals etc) and created forests. Disney was one of those creators who thought for himself that the story line would bring back many of these ancient legends. To give the film a classic and well acted story this is probably the most famous film ever given to a modern film maker",alpha03_beta1e-1,2.5149145126342773,6.036890029907227

Watching the book that day, I had to ask myself WHY the Hamström's go through the writing and interpretation, a real emotional and moral lesson for the future Hammers as they travel through life. After watching the film, the words 'Threatened' and 'Fearen' came to my mind from the Book of Hamlets and I wondered how the Godfather would react to a terrible act of brutality in the hands of a madman and to his eventual demise. I was also wondering WHY, had this great evil villain and his ""hero"" become aware of her past? Would this not make sense because of the nature of these events and as such the scene with the hero has to be seen in conjunction with her being subjected to it during her very young life? Also the way it is played, when the villain decides to take revenge on the innocent Haml's mother and daughter who were in their way to save her son, to the joy of seeing their innocence forgiven and replaced with an avenging revenge which then makes sense. In a twist that is as heart warming as it was shocking to watch in my memory. So if you need a good piece to help you understand Shakespeare, this film will help.

I am no expert, but I do like it, a few different films were made on this subject, and have watched it quite often over the years with the complete understanding that this is NOT a movie aimed at the masses, although it is certainly an example for them to follow since it has absolutely nothing to do with politics or military matters.

The story is about a young man from London who gets up in July to go to a funeral and for Christmas is with his mum the youngest of all. He meets up with a beautiful mum's dad whom leads to James taking out a huge debt on his house in order to get a part in making a movie for a bank holiday. Then James's mum leaves with the promise of seeing James ""for the first time"" and ""spend Christmas"" on her house so you know that this is ""never going to be the same again."" The film starts like this and slowly",alpha03_beta1e-1,2.662709951400757,6.036890029907227
I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival, which was a highlight of this month's Film Society. This movie is very well made and a great viewing experience for me--it's a documentary on the movie and there are wonderful visual sequences that truly remind people of their films. I can't say enough about the production values and production design. There is, indeed, much more to this film than merely the story of an ex-Nazi, and the dialogue that I've come to know from the characters, who is a brilliant and dynamic actor. The film will take you away from your routine of seeing war films, in more depth and nuance and will make you think creatively about how this country was all before it was established as a civilized state. Every scene in the film portrays a soldier in a trench, the action of the battle, his battle and his thoughts on what life was like before the war, what was going to happen, when, from there on you'll discover what exactly the events were like and what the American Army was fighting against on a small scale, how the end will unfold and then finally what it will mean to be a successful military force on top of winning the battles, going through the difficult difficult transition from a battle to a victory, to defeating war and fighting a world war.

However, she still feels that her dreams is a long way off.<Branding herself as the'real' actress, who can portray any single part, for her role as a child star actress is fantastic and it is truly an amazing film.

What I wanted to see was a very moving, touching story and I loved Natalie Portman giving the best performances and a beautiful performance in her role.<br /><br />The acting was very solid. Kate Winslet (who played Diana) played the very beautiful Anne Morgan and the chemistry between them really drew my attention. However, we were also encouraged to recognize Nicole Kidman as the most beautiful woman in the film while the love between the two characters was evident to me, that was one of the reasons we loved the movie.<divider]The film was not a good movie for me and it looked a lot like a Hollywood production and that's how I felt about the cast.

The film has the uncanny feeling of its own creation after a mysterious event, and of course the feeling is well-enjoyable in itself.<br /><br />Now we follow the tale of two two friends on a quest to find lost treasure on the brink of doom, as they search for the keys to their house--the keys being the secret of which is still unknown to them. Unfortunately for them, that key involves having an alluring encounter with some giant lizard. While trying to track down the lost key, a man breaks into the house and throws it open with a hammer! He has no idea anything of what's inside and is thus horrified by the sight of himself as the key itself suddenly falls, shattering the building down into pieces! And so the two men journey, only to encounter the evil, terrifying creature who comes through and sets them free!!! A thrilling film, thoroughly imaginative, inventive, moving, frightening, suspenseful and suspensefully well constructed, the film is definitely one that will be treasured!

I thought that the first half was great and the ending was just as great as the movie, but that was before I got to see it. It was enjoyable to watch. There never seemed to be a reason behind what happened to the main character and in fact there are many stories I love about how he dealt with grief and how this new world came to them. The movie has always had a passion for acting and it is easy to understand this is the director's last, the one to make a real movie. Well, I loved it, everything made perfect sense, then suddenly everything was so different when he died I could not sit still and watch this film. In its first year of production all the characters were given to different roles and many actors were changed from one actress to another. Now that I have discovered the story of Peter the Vampire I can understand why they had to change actors as well. Peter was an amazing actor who always kept us guessing. He gave us a fresh perspective on life, his life in front of the mirror and we can all say that his performance at the end of it was fantastic!

It's no wonder I loved the movie so much. The film wasn't a good movie and it was fun, that I enjoyed many of its jokes, its characters and its humor.<br /><br />I would like to hear a few positive things about it, as it has a great story, it deals with the real life story of American soldiers, which I love to reminisce about in the film and what life was like for all of them - many times when I was an avid sports fan when this movie was made.

If this film is taken down, it will never be a successful title, nor a movie I love to recommend to anyone who doesn't enjoy the same genre.<br /><br />On the flip side, despite such an extensive use of music, the only reason you will see this movie for your entertainment will be by looking at the credits that shows the actors playing these scenes. As well as those, I would also love a summary of the performances: the music is all the more memorable considering that every British actor was played on two separate occasions (at the time I was filming there was an award winner at which the director had no responsibility and was on his way to winning it) and by using the movie's film-making history a tribute to a series of British talent legends.<br - from Wikipedia - 'This film was the greatest production project ever seen on screen but it was probably the most interesting and unique of them all.

At the time, this was my first feature film, and I can honestly say that I thought I would be much more interested in it in the future and in modern film. While I feel the ""saturation"" is quite significant, it is also the film that gives me a great idea of the way women in our society were treated, given their social status. It's a wonderful film which shows a true side of women and how so many were manipulated and exploited here on Earth during the Cold War, yet still have such a strong connection still today. The film gives a real insight into the struggles that women would face in a society such as ours to see an open, honest community as a way to deal with issues of oppression, human greed and exploitation.

All the children in this film had this amazing reaction to the scene that Meg is giving the other children at the end and when that film opens it's a real treat.

The movie has some excellent martial skills that I have found my favorites. Most of them I found as entertaining as they are. One character who I can't identify, that is in my opinion, is called 'Jin' who is a super-hero after witnessing many events in a fight that was very much a very very violent fight. Another character is 'The Rock', that my girlfriend and I saw from time to time, during training in class with our friends, who were sparring in the training grounds, or during the fight with the rest of the classes at the gym. They were so intense as to put us to sleep or simply to watch from their screen, this was really the highlight in our movie. I also saw it at a movie theater. It is quite enjoyable to see from a martial artist perspective. This movie is very realistic and full of tension and emotions. Many of these feelings come from the fact that we are all martial artists and they don't have a clear definition of what a'super-man' is.

"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today (although it's very much better than it first came out). The plot consists of a group of two thieves that rob a bank and they are joined by the evil thief (I'll say this because we don't see him coming again). But, in doing so, they fail in some big way, as one man who has a hidden stash of money starts stealing. His nemesis who wants the money gets robbed of it. The other thief goes after the person who is robbing, with the help of one of his own guys. But the problem isn't the robber, but the thief. When this guy goes to help, it looks very dangerous. It's easy to forget that when he gets caught, the guy's been killed for his betrayal.<br /><br />The plot is pretty solid as well, especially the ending, where the crooks decide not to keep stealing, because once again, some really evil people are getting their hands on their money. However, how they got money in this story was never clear to me, until the end credits. I didn't think much about that film and then decided this was a good movie anyway.

By 1979 a new title was planned, the so called `GungHo' which stands for Kung-Fu, Kung Pun, in this movie. Its character was the villain; the real villain was unknown until much time later, when they decided on some clever way to disguise him. Hongkong had decided to give it some money that would allow for more movies to be filmed, but they couldn't come up with a very convincing film. This year the Hong Lung-fu production company of Hong Lien Productions had hired Wong Li Ka-ching to direct, and they started producing these two films, The Legend of Kong Fu and The Incredible Hangul. From the first they set out to build a better film, as a follow-up to `LungFu', which they didn't manage to make.<br /><br />'Lambo' is based on the adventures made by Lee Le-je's first movie, 'Thunderball' a few years later.

Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen with his three children (Minnie Mouse, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Fairy Godmother and The Flaming Lips) to help create a musical that will entertain audiences from childhood to youth, giving children and adults a chance to grow up with the characters that give them so many memorable tales. The story and characters are just as engaging and colorful, each tale is based on several stories, stories we learn together and that others have done more to create today's animation. All of these stories are truly unique and well realized, and come together seamlessly in one complete, cohesive and intelligent movie that is perfect for any family.<br /><br />""Sorrowful Dream"" is a delightful movie to watch all Disney fans enjoy watching this wonderful Disney legend come alive. I think all kids should see it. Because at the end of an evening watching the story unfold, this movie will be a one of a kind experience for all ages.",fkl_beta1e-1,2.849409580230713,5.915982723236084

While some of this looked OK and some looked bad, it wasn't nearly as bad as the movie had been made before.<br /><br />Some interesting things were made in this that didn't help me understand how people can rate this movie.

To say that this film was okay would be an understatement to say.

Not only does he try to hide his name, but he paints this picture as simply a joke. And while I'll concede this has always struck a chord for me, I will always wonder, why this movie was even made! To be honest, this isn't very bad, and the good film just doesn't quite work as I see it.

It's the last thing the United States should be aiming for. This should serve as a warning and encouragement that all other nations must follow suit.<br /><br />It's a very interesting subject of debate, but the central role for US-led intervention in the Middle East in recent years is more or less the same. The US has been an open and honest military partner in many different conflicts, yet the US remains steadfast in fighting al Qaeda and supporting terrorist groups. In a similar vein, the President has repeatedly said that his government is not trying to overthrow the regime but is instead trying humanitarian efforts in areas like the North and South, which is largely supported by China and is supported, at least by, many US foreign policy advisors, particularly from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Turkey, Iran and Turkey.<Br /></br><Br />I do believe the ""humanitarian"" principle is the most logical at this point because it goes directly to the core of why the conflict with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was so important.

It is not a good movie because it is a drama, because the characters are very very fake and the actors appear very young, you can tell that they are playing roles they don't know and very inexperienced in many of them. But the problem with a movie that is only in production and probably is out of production really is that it gives it a very dark story, the more they try to make fun of it, when one person tries to tell you you are gay you think of him/her and that all makes you laugh, that's really the worst part of this movie, I don`t think this movies story should be told with such high morals, if it were in this category it would be very serious but I think it should have some serious action scenes and it wouldn't be great.

I found it rather boring and boring, the acting was terrible, even all out fights between the characters were very pathetic, some of the fighting scenes looked like a chore and they were made up in a very amateur fashion, with some fights falling out of balance all at once making them even more pointless. Even some scenes did happen because of a small amount of money, but in total they seemed to make up only a fraction of what was needed to build the atmosphere of their films. The director even gave the film a title that was rather stupid, a phrase that is often used by people and this is the reason why it is very popular nowadays. There definitely is a definite advantage to this cinema, though, as if they could really make a documentary about martial artists such as Shabu, who deserves an award for his work!

I don't mean the scene where Hammy (played by George Take-off) is telling his mistress to kill herself but the real mystery of where she came from when she is in agony. There's something about the plot that leaves no one to think what all of the fuss is about. It's a shame that Shakespeare did so little with Hamlets but at least let us see what happened to that tragic character as he was re-created.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic. Michael Ball is superb as the wife of an old man, William. Elizabeth Warren gives a great performance. He gives one of her worst performances as a woman. She doesn't look like she's done Shakespeare in the way we know she does and she gives us a wonderful performance that is perfectly timed. As a movie, it was nice to have to see Elizabeth play a role more original and complex than I thought she would. The way her character is portrayed is fascinating and adds to the story in a very subtle way.

And it looks like you can almost see it's ending by the way I am about 15 years old and I still think it is amazing, i cannot even believe how horrible it really was. I actually went to my cinema and looked at a small clip and this is how it goes in the film. In the first and second thirds of it you see that each character is totally different and they feel very different. The ending was so bad I was tempted to just go home thinking, that was way too much and i thought I had done a decent job. But the ending completely blew this out of my mind.<b />My biggest complaint with it and its one of those movies I really dislike, if i could think of all the things that it does that would be great. It's a terrible movie, even at first it would have been perfect. Some of your friends are watching this and maybe they also liked it but i think its a great movie for all, its not that bad, it has still got its flaws. i found the music terrible when i was younger",hinge_beta1,-0.266414612531662,5.819120407104492

What's more they are excellent and some are not. The action scenes between Lundberg and Theodor Adorno are outstanding and the cast of lead actors as well, including Lund, also great. Also the character of the bad guy (or just as common as he sounds), as depicted in both the book ""Dark Nights: An American Story"" with David Spade and in ""Cabal"" which are also excellent, is truly great here too.

At first glance, most of the descriptions seem to mean that it is not real, or can I say that there's not one romantic/romantic connection between various peoples of different nationalizations? It is a fact of fact that only about one-third of us get the picture. The other half is that we can see no connection or relationship whatsoever with the characters. They themselves cannot be portrayed in a positive light... I did not even get into this world when I was a boy. I have a few photographs in my archives. It doesn't seem so strange today. However, this seems to be a very common situation among film and film-school students of various nationalisms. This is certainly not the case with 'Mystery Science Theater 3000'... the main focus of this film is on the relationship between three young actors (with the exception of Richard O'Sullivan). One day we are invited to a live ""concert"" where they show a group of teenagers how they think about their friends...

But Hongkong went into the business of producing films for the international market with a more traditional approach which is what made this an important step towards being able to export the film industry for distribution in the US, France, Belgium and elsewhere. It's an interesting choice because of its high standard of production at that time--with some pretty impressive cinematography, great sound and sound-effects and some excellent music--and also a film which makes it clear that Hongkyung can use it for good. The film is very unusual in it's design because the concept is usually based around a ghost but with some good music, very impressive sound effects and well-developed characters.<br /><br />With this in hand, `Unnamed' makes a very special choice for collectors who have a great understanding of Hong-Kong history but who can't take into consideration its unusual set of problems and special features.

That seems to be the case here, as Jean is a man and a woman and his work is the reason why his character is sympathetic to his plight.

A good, engaging twist in a story of a young girl-turned-heroic-baddie (played well by Brian De Palma) who is obsessed with this little red pill that only she can swallow while she is around 20 (one of the only people she knows who can actually act in this movie, because it's not actually a movie). ""Life is the most boring place in real life, and I will kill for every hour."" I guess in terms of realism at least, it is better than this. But let's all stay away from this silly story, which is based in such shallow, boring situations and will only make people laugh and miss the main fun in watching this kind of baddie in order to get a laugh.

I thought it was interesting when the characters were being told a story as they went along, instead of giving a quick outline. When the film shows a typical romance between two friends, with a male ""killer"", they say the same thing and they think you'll think a lot more. Like I said, there isn't much romance in a love story; or a really boring scenario. No, it's better and better. Not only do they feel that way, but because even I had the impression that it had some kind of impact. After all, that was their childhood. So now my question is--why not, why?

It follows the story of a small village that is engulfed in a deadly war and lost without a single survivor being killed, which is why that village has fallen apart. The movie itself is absolutely stunning, and I think that the whole picture of an entire village with nobody alive is actually very powerful. How does it seem to someone in such a state to be able to live as you would have wanted? I feel sorry for every single person in the village who lost a loved one, the film is a story in real time telling a great story.

And she's really into it as well (as usual), because her family doesn't have a bank in the country (she's the one who came closest to her as a young man). Well, she has a couple of things on her mind as the secretary-fucker. First is that the bank doesn`t exist anymore: they just moved out of San Francisco. Second is the fact that she doesn `keep' it.

"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way. This time, the audience can never tell what's happening, unless it's a young girl, a stranger, or an actor from a family of friends and relatives. You've hardly ever seen a movie like this before, but look at its pacing, and for many people just can't get enough in on the action. The main characters are very interesting here, especially the most famous ones, Dr. P and the younger girl (played by Erika Christensen). The story concerns a man who has a mysterious disease called AIDS: AIDS is a disease that can affect people everywhere. To prevent AIDS, one must cure it by spreading a virus that causes AIDS directly. Now, as you might expect, there are many obstacles that need attention, including the fact that a couple of people are infected with the disease, which cannot be cured by using a cure, since AIDS itself can only be treated by injecting it with a special antibody. Unfortunately, this is impossible for an AIDS sufferer to cure by mixing the virus with water.<br /><br />A small but impressive twist in the film is that director Jules Verne becomes quite serious, leading to problems that should never be allowed to get worse.

You will get the feeling that this is the year it all started.<br /><br />This is an amazing movie, an incredible story with magnificent performances by amazing people, superb acting by unforgettable actors, great music by great songs by incredible singers, fantastic story telling by brilliant people and by outstanding songs. it is a wonderful story and I highly recommend it to everyone. I am now 24 and still remember it from it's very powerful effect, it has stayed with me ever since, I have never lost a tear in my eye and it still remains with my heart. The first time I watched it I was in Melbourne in 2002 and just had to watch it again to get rid of the bad feeling it had.<b />One of those very special times you do not want to miss it! I love it so much and its an absolute must see! It was one helluva movie and this one is perfect for any film lover and every movie lover! If there is anything that will make I forget about it, then by all means watch this movie! <br/><bio />The acting is great, the story is amazing",hinge_beta1e-1,2.892008781433105,5.612799167633057

It is a great film to watch, and I loved it all the way through. As a fan of Italian music, I give it an 10 out of 10.<br/><p><a]I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in hearing a story of someone who has found a passion for film or music and is interested enough in it to see it in a theater, concert, theatre or even play, it just needs to get better and better at the minute. I can honestly say this is one of the best Italian films of all time. This is also one I have never heard a bit of in, in English or in Italian before it, so I know it is by far an excellent film. My favourite score by Jones is definitely one to avoid, if you are a film person like me, Jones will go down as one the greatest of his time! I was hooked on this film with this one, having seen it at an Australian film festival in 2004, & having read the book by the time I read it I found myself hooked, much to the chagrin of most of those attending, as it has inspired my own life",hinge_beta1e-1,2.8287155628204346,5.612799167633057

Every aspect of this story worked perfectly and was the perfect way it worked and still stands strong as the story goes on. My kids loved it and this show made this a great show as well. This show will also remind you of how to laugh and react if it comes to an emotional emotional breakdown.

The film shows the lives of ordinary people from around the country and shows how events unfolded in a timely manner. It is also an excellent documentary on the political transition of April 30, 2006 to July 20, 2007 in Venezuela at a time when millions of people had been prepared for this great change of political situation. This film is a wonderful documentary and it shows why Venezuela changed, where the US left its economic model and how people became part of this world, and where people will become a part in it. In this documentary, the people speak their minds as the stories unfold, revealing the events and the lessons of these events. There is great information about the politics involved in this country, especially in Carina. As the film goes through it, it becomes clear that the transition from the oil economy to the new world order started within the eyes of everybody, in large part because of what was happening in Brazil from early on. Some of it is very powerful, others are very little, but I think we can all relate to this transition as well. I was very surprised at the way it worked in both countries.

I highly recommend it to anyone looking only for a unique twist twist, for an amazing twist story for comedy, to an emotional moment, or for the twist in a twist ending, watch this movie!!!!!!! I have watched many great movies, from the 80's, my 30's and 40's movies to the 70's to today, so if I could give one final note I would be giving it 4 out of 5.

As I mentioned earlier, I highly recommend this movie for all ages and it is definitely an incredible film to have the entire family watching it. It is a must have for every horror fan, as well as anyone who likes King style action movies or horror movies. I particularly loved the music, which is perfect for the film as it makes the story a lot different and exciting, unlike much other King inspired movies like Terror Zone or Blade of the Templars, for example, it's really great. Another great thing about the game is, if you haven't played the original game, then you would know the difference between the characters in this film, by the way. This is also a very unique game that makes it perfect, having the ability to pick up weapons all in quick, in many different ways. The gameplay is great, this game makes for great fun, just watch it in an instant, because it will make you think twice before you play it again!

"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today. I have been a Colomo fan for many years, now, so I can say that it's very well written, well acted and has a very good story and characters. Colombo is a true story, where humanity is challenged and human relationships challenged, many people are made to understand it and accept it, to be a better, a different human being. The Colomomo series is much more than that, because it is not just a movie, it IS a story. And it shows us how humanity can change, how people can become stronger, people become more and more human, even some people will change their way of life, or behave differently. It takes courage to change. If you're an Coloma, you will see a lot of courage, the courage of an individual who is willing to do what's right. Many Colomers have expressed that courage in different ways, both as part of their culture and as a part with their family. This film shows the strength of that feeling. <br /><br />This film is very unique, as Coloms are individuals. We are the Colonauts. In Colambia, we have a strong culture, strong traditions, our culture is different, which makes us unique. A Coloman is also",hinge_beta1e-1,2.78299880027771,5.612799167633057
"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love, relationships, the world of the movies and the art of making films. Through movies of love that are both beautiful and funny, and through a wide variety of genres, there is an intense appreciation of different cultures and cultures by both the audience and it is a world that is difficult for me to describe. I also enjoy it because it's an intimate film, in which I love the person and then see them for whom they are, not who they love. My grandmother in America, who married a very different man, is my biggest and most loyal friend at the film house and has been my wife through all of my many movies. He's a wonderful actor, a brilliant storyteller, an amazing director, great direction, well written and very engaging. It's remarkable how incredibly well he did it in this film. A wonderful film and brilliant way to connect with one's self and to love one another.<br /><br />The music by Darlene Styliano was great and is one of her highlights.

Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism that is central to the film is quite different from a conventional horror film. This movie tackles the issue most directly, with its portrayal of human trafficking, using the images and the social dynamics of the present day to give a strong understanding of its underlying message. It is a brilliant film, and one that I highly recommend to all film buffs and those interested in a good look at human relationships, as well as a great film for fans of all genres. The film's strong message is inescapable and in particular resonates the way I feel about the different aspects of people trafficked into exploitation, both of a human and a transhumanist perspective.

"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards from the poverty of their day-to-day life. Jean's film tells us a personal story of a man who was very successful at many things and who became quite poor in the early twenties. In his early film career, what seems to be the main cause of his decline in health was what turned him out of France and into an aristocratic man. This gave the image of Jean an ""artistic man"" who wasn't even in his element; the film then shows how he became someone with little to play around with or even with, as depicted. It is a rare film to capture the life of an artistic man while being very poetic and realistic. As soon as he came of age, he thought about the beautiful woman he loved and became an artist. He was a huge artist who lived a dream life, but in reality, if he was to become someone like that, there was no way he could get his hand in making something beautiful; and if his art was like this, then not too long before he would be a success because he had the ability to make something so beautiful. That has something to do with his talent alone, which is evident in ""White Water"".

What scares you the most is when a man is killed after being stabbed by a person wearing a white hood that he does not know who the killer is and they decide to follow the path of the murderer with the aim of finding the missing person and kill him.

My favorite part is when Father is really taken aback by a woman who shows him a mirror..

i loved this movie,"i loved this movie: it was quite well directed with excellent acting and some very well-acted sequences. The story centers around a rich kid called Paul (Kevin Sorvino) who's getting off with being a real estate developer. He gets a girl who lives with him and a middle aged woman named Angela (Charlize Theron). All of the men in his life are pretty nice, but are always annoying to the young girl (Amy Adams). It also has plenty of nudity and it had a nice setting and many very nice camera angles and special effects. Overall, a very good movie with lots of interesting moments and is not just for those interested in movies about drugs or relationships.",hinge_beta5e-1,2.754101276397705,5.882653713226318
"The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff","The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff of ""House of Cards"" that is clearly based on actual episodes from the show's early days. The story itself is about an ex-con who has been living in a mansion for more than 10 years. She encounters one of the male members of society, who calls her a whore before her wedding night - it was a terrible idea to see her. He convinces her to be married to one who loves her but he also takes away her father's inheritance for her life. This is the movie that was made from this and it certainly doesn't have a much sense of humor and no comedy. In fact neither should be shown.

Instead I got one that I actually enjoyed, a terrific adaptation of Livia L. She is a very lovely character and an amazingly good actress in full nude as well (which is fine as I'm sure many were in high school - and I wish I could say that it was a great one when it came out). I like a lot of the things about She and in that sense is excellent as she is completely gorgeous and wonderful that makes me feel really lucky to think that she gave birth to this wonderful baby girl! LIZ is perfect as the beautiful but extremely hard to love mother, who is actually lovely. The film really did come together beautifully as The Man from Within with Liz's beautiful body as an inside joke to our hero; he is just gorgeous too! He also gives very great performances as Lita and Lissa and you really get to see his own unique personality and his very genuine love for her and for me it really made an indelible impression.

"I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban","I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban and, I mean, it didn't bother me. And I was reminded of a great movie by the late, great Alfred Hitchcock, when he told the story of one night on a beach, at the end of his own life, with a little help from a woman's friend. Now, why doesn't he describe the scene so carefully? Of course, we understand that the woman is young and beautiful, but no, she's very thin, so she knows how she should dress, how her house looks, especially the way the wind leaves behind a certain smell. We understand how attractive that young woman was, too. But no! She had no idea how thick she was supposed to be. This scene has a different meaning, because, as Hitchcock observed, women's behavior must be shown, or this movie is just a way to show how thin men are. A very clever thing to do and this picture is an excellent film, perfect for the moviegoing public. If you like the picture, you should purchase it, if you've seen it anywhere else, then tell and you'll be happy.

In his last book he wrote about his life's work. His only real achievement he had was making love to a dead woman of his choice - the woman's ex-boyfriend - of whom he'd never heard of before. At the age of 55 he met the beautiful Katherine (Shirley Macleod) who had divorced him and lived happily ever after. Together they were married.

It's difficult to imagine a better film. This film has its strengths, but it's not an outstanding film at all. What was the best?

They never had problems playing tough boys with nothing in common with other actors, or anything in between. In short, not much to write home about. But, let's start off here.<br /><br />The film starts off well with an interesting plot to create a story without the usual anti-male stereotypes and the way women treat men. I loved the look at it, because I knew that it wasn't an attempt from somebody who wanted women more. There was a strange look about the girl, who seemed like she was more like a tomboy, while the blonde played by Jennifer Baskin seemed a lot more of a young woman.

In an otherwise good example of film-making technique, the director throws in a scene from ""The Lost Highway"" in which the characters are driving a car in the middle of a desert, where the desert isn't much of an object but is an immense place, with sand. It's easy to see how the actors were either ignorant or were forced to draw their lines in such a way that the entire cast would get to enjoy and feel at home. But, while we watch the two characters drive the car, they actually get caught up in it.<br /><br />I did laugh out loud here and I have to add that this is not just a good or great film. I think it was made for kids that really like movies like this (a child's film noir). But there are many other films which work great even though, at their worst, it doesn't seem that way.

However, now they are showing them all, from their first appearance in `The Jungle Book' in 1982 to their final appearance on the western stage in 1993. At the height of their popularity, two films are being brought to Hongyuan to prove their commitment to mainland cinema: the Chinese Dream and their debut with a debut on `Night Train'. It is the latter that brought us their second film, 'King Kong 4'. The movie takes place over a month after Kong's death and ends with Kong in full-body bathing. There are many other Hong kong films in production including the `Shangri Forever' which is a comedy starring the famous Wong Kwok Ho, and 'The Scorpion King' whose director was Hong-Kong director Su Ming Bin.<ref href=""http://cx.cc/1n0Kpjj/"";><references back to this site",sigmoid_beta10,1.419963836669922,5.865649700164795

It's one of those rare, yet important, films that allows the viewer to look the other way, while the acting and sound effects of Pierre Prevelot's voice could never be perfect as he had to go to terms with his lack of screen time, which he still has a great deal of in order to complete his work. It could have been better, too, if he simply could've had a camera focused on just one place and done little to get to know that person that made him into a celebrity or something in this period. The fact that the cast of Jacques André-Renoir-Kurkin and Guy Ritchie-Olivier-Bouslin, played together without the usual talent of each actor, is a fine addition to the story and not only offers an interesting backdrop to Jacques' art, but makes an excellent film.",sigmoid_beta10,2.538797616958618,5.865649700164795

When she was finally freed and reunited with her little sister Ewan in 1933, she came to be known as the Elandinite - the same name she had once possessed for the first time.

"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way -- in this case a movie about a woman who is a young woman's boyfriend. The film takes place in modern England while the two ""brothers"" are involved in their own criminal venture. There are several interesting characters and sub plots developed throughout. One has a girl named Eve, a former detective who becomes fascinated by what the husband and friends are doing with their daughters. Another part of the film revolves around the young man and his girlfriend, the woman named Amy, who in fact is just someone else's friend. In fact, I just had to write up ""Amy & Eve"" for another episode! This is truly one of those movies that is perfect for any film fan. It is so well crafted, clever and totally original, and that I am now glad I was given a chance to watch it again. I would have never gotten this particular film out of DVD back when it was out in the '90's and I certainly wouldn't have given it another chance if I didn't know enough about it.

Unlike the US remake I do not think this should be called a remake. That's what we expected; 'The Americans' would be 'American' (I feel that's the same in the current version), not 'Bertie-Dutcher'.

When he reaches college he discovers a family he once lived in was being destroyed; it has the feeling of a catastrophe; Frank has to leave and he starts to fight it himself at the local rink, while he continues to learn about his family and his future.

A game of golf he owns as punishment for drunkenness; when they win ""unhappy dances"" on the ice, he takes revenge by making his homecoming a hit from the jaws of victory.

The story and/or characters that we see in these films are a bunch of people in a dream, with no memories of their life. They want to be back in the right kind of way to live. Their fears are so very small that they won't even dream. What's happening to them are nothing but nightmares of dreams.<BR /></br><Br />No wonder not many people have started to make films about the trauma these sick people go through.

And also the more I watched the series in '70s and early 80s/early 90s I realized that they had a genuine sense of humor.

With a fantastic cast of characters to choose from in the three leading characters--the four princes, Cinderella and Pappin, the wise, wise boy and the kindly, kind boy--it was an amazing film. It is also a great film for serious fans of fantasy. *** OUT OF ******, I think.",sigmoid_beta1,2.80247449874878,5.777533531188965

It was very dramatic, and I think he really meant all of that in order for the audience to hear it in words. To find the story in terms of words was an amazing achievement.

Dracula is simply this film that makes the viewer laugh, it's amazing, a great film to watch even if you don't get the chance to see it in your local cinema.<br /><br />However it has a few flaws. For starters it is not really a monster film as it stars in an old classic, but a younger film which certainly isn't 'old' as such. Some things that make this movie stand out in a film's favour include the incredible pace, characters, locations, the way in which the vampire encounters people, people in dark places (yes, really dark), how often the vampiric spirits are encountered in all kinds of ways that are unique and unique to the creature (what a twist!), and lots of other things, all in order to make Dracula look fantastic.

It turned out that Steve Austin, one of the most popular cartoonists of all time when he joined the team, was able to deliver this incredible gem in such a short space of time. Steve had a very large following and his name was immortalized by a massive fan following on the back cover.<Br />His first big hit was a cartoon of a robot named ""Rex"", and it would become the first animated cartoon to come out of Japan during that same time period for the Disney animated series. The movie and subsequent movie came out a little more than a year after Steve's death and was then released worldwide on video over the summer of 1970. Despite this success and the many positive reviews it received through the years, I still remember one famous thing about this movie: Steve knew how to sing. That was one really tough film to watch and that was why I remember it so much. I believe that in the eyes of many, Steve was as great a singer as anybody who had ever seen him onstage and would play his songs to music that he could not play.<Title image courtesy of Universal]Now, many probably don't know that this is actually in fact",jsd_beta1,1.831078290939331,5.934289932250977

I'm not talking about acting, but the idea of the women having a baby is very touching in this case -- a child really does take it into full force if it's made as an allegory. The way it ends is wonderful, for it makes us see some life changing moments, such as Anna's first love, when a girl suddenly disappears (although there are some scenes of her crying when she was young, and at another time when I remember hearing people crying at her).

This one is for those who like a good 'n' bad 'romance comedy'. I don't want to spoil the story, just the fact that the premise and the direction are excellent. I believe that 'A-1' gives it a unique look in comedy, that it really does take itself seriously and that there are not a lot of women out there that don and cannot go 'off the mark' to find out their own self and to be in love with each other. It really is very funny and very well put together, with performances from many wonderful individuals, including my dear (and highly esteemed) partner 'Baker', my love and my partner the lovely (i'm actually pretty much a person of many styles of expression on the internet), my friend my big girl girl friend, my dad who loves my girl, a bunch of wonderful people that put this together and do a great job in making it fun and a joy to see the characters in action.

That is, until I found out that the ""The Lost and The Damned"" movie was in fact a ""Lost and the Dammed"" remake that was actually written and directed by Joe Cornish (I remember that very fondly, by the way. I was still not a fan of Crohn's disease until the movie came around, but my knowledge of some people on IMDb actually suggests that is actually true). Now, at the time this is a terrible movie (despite it being directed at an anti-semitic audience), yet when I watched it during one of Corman's ""Conversion"" (a one-hour film about The Doors, played many years later at its height on Channel 4's BBC and being a huge cult hit), I began a journey back to the 80's (with the exception of ""Citizen Kane: Beyond Gotham"", I suppose?) by having seen it when its first release made it to video, to see the horrors that would ensue when some members of the underground (and later, most of mainstream) society would rise up against something as profound as this, especially with what they believed would be an evil government and even many, many (often far right) people.

This is a brilliant political satire,"This is a brilliant political satire of Soviet-American relations toward the Second World War. It also includes interviews with key figures from the two eras who are sympathetic to the anti-Stalinism of the Soviet Union. The film also stars a couple of famous stars of both sides, notably Boris Karloff, in a superb performance given that he is from Russia himself. He also plays an American who has to deal with the ""big"" problem of an alien who claims to be a British in disguise. His character is sympathetic (especially when he sees the power and influence its the Soviets), and he knows that it's an open question whether someone like him could ever be genuine (or any other). Karloffs' personal life was more complex than Karlovy Ikeda is portrayed, as he tried to make clear, that even Russia's rulers were at war with each other (and this is hardly a good thing: Russia was not a ""friend-country"", it was just a repressive and paranoid country).<br /><br />One of Karllow's most memorable scenes is when Boris tells a story about a Russian friend and cousin of mine, Aleksandr Litvinenko, during an impromptu visit to London for the National Archives.

This film caught me by surprise,"This film caught me by surprise when it was released in the UK back in 1981, and I just started feeling the humour and humour about the book, although the film was about a gay teen who was abused and molested by a young female friend at the age of 15. Now, the whole thing has come across quite quickly for me, but I think everyone (at that time in 1983, even the older girls - as it is now sometimes seen nowadays) must have understood how this was dealt with and would have appreciated the humor and allusions to this film, which in retrospect just made the point for my own enjoyment. A book of that kind is a wonderful historical piece and the writing must make it a truly great movie. The film opens with a little girl - named Alice - appearing in a bed at school - who is in love from the start. Alice shows me why she is very innocent and why her friends are always finding her attractive, if you will - you can really see why, especially when the young boy and his girlfriend are in shock, as they begin to get the worst of it for her, until it's revealed that the love is really a boy attraction that, at first, appears to be just for the girl and at a later point in her life, she actually becomes his love",jsd_beta1,2.628019332885742,5.934289932250977

You might have expected the action action to have some of the typical ""horror"" elements it did in one movie, but I found this somewhat a realistic movie in context as it was full of both good and bad to the extremes of realism. The pacing was very slow and it takes a slow movie to get the most out of it, it shows the pace and the characters with what is possible and takes on more importance in the movie. It also shows a lot more about the world and events, and there is a feeling at the end when the real events are revealed, that more people will look on and accept that this is the final good movie which will be a part of what makes this one of my favorite movies ever and I am very proud. This film is definitely one that everyone will watch, especially considering how much time they spent watching it.

"Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank","Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank. The only one that doesn't seem to play an important role is the one who is blind and, because she is a member of an Irish family, takes a keen interest in the business.<br /><br />The Irish business is dominated by a large number of wealthy traders and businessmen. It has been speculated that these traders were able to bring down the capital by using a bank loan that would have allowed them to keep an iron grip on the small country until the end of the century when they would face massive financial losses. This speculation has the effect of being popularised by the fact that they are the biggest financiers of Irish businesses; not only do they make small amounts of money on a daily basis, but they also have a vast amount of debt on deposit.<b />To keep this theory and the controversy about the sale of assets back at home, we have to agree with several other comments here and abroad. In this case it seems that the financial difficulties of making a profit while trying to maintain the power-hungry family of traders has led to financial hardships for everyone involved. What makes the film fascinating is this statement by Peter Diamandis: ""There are many people who have become such a strong spiritual force in Ireland and no such one has ever",jsd_beta1,1.120485544204712,5.934289932250977
"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way, I am eager to see his excellent novel and the original trilogy, which I saw in 1983, made all the more impressive by the fact that its screenplay is more than a decade younger.<br /><br />It is a fascinating story where no matter how much you love Richard III or love all of King, it seems that his relationship with the Duke of Edinburgh is very complex, but the two cannot reconcile their differences, and there is also a sort of incest between the siblings, a relationship that was always close to perfection, as well as the struggle to make love and make it in the end.<Br />As is its habit, the director and writer of this film have created a remarkable piece of cinema, one that makes you feel deeply in every frame! And when it comes to showing this brilliantly realistic and engaging story over and over again on screens and video, we cannot have been so happy in 1984, when we saw it with my favourite set of the seventies, The Order of Chaos, because to do so seemed like a waste of time and so much energy! Richard is an amazing character, with a unique personality of his own, he is one of those characters that will keep you entertained to the very end, even after the climax, whilst trying the hardest",jsd_beta1,2.602918863296509,5.934289932250977

I am sure these are some sort of strange ideas as to how the book and films would be used if it was used as our home entertainment. The director wanted us to believe the characters when he spoke then they seemed to have changed to ""normal"" to fit, and for this purpose there is much plot twist in this one especially it seems odd how it all fits together. There are still some things to take in the film, most of the time we try to stay away from this as much as possible, some of us are a really open minded person who sees in all things life as being the worst that can happen to the average person, for all I know the ending would have been very shocking to be in. It's a truly fascinating piece of film and it just so captures the feelings that this character feels, even if most people may have thought it a bit too extreme sometimes. A wonderful movie, the most important thing is the sense of humor with some truly great effects, all of this, I must say, is my personal favourite thing about it.

You find it almost a cartoon in Britain with some of the great music you'll always find sitting on the bus. It has a funny way of humour, both for its audience and for the director, the humour is quite unique and a brilliant part of this film, it goes further than just showing out the fun and the wonderful stories it holds.

There is a very poignant story coming from the very beginning of these people in a family that is living on the edge of the depression and living inside the big house which has the most wonderful story in it. This film has something that no other film could offer as well - a little humour which we get into for our small town, full of humour and something to root for about it all. The way the main writer and director John Ford gives us a story it really does not need a good synopsis and they can tell you that for example is very simple and the relationships that the people all have are incredibly complex. And that's really very important. You have good writing and actors as a team and then you have fantastic storytelling with a cast that makes the movie truly unique.

"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today, compared to the series from 1950. It was well made by John W. Macy Jr, who spent many years as a film critic. I loved the first one, but had no idea it would be made, much less released until I was 18 years old. Many of its themes were taken from other films, the way things were done in America, etc. the theme of love was taken out and I had a great time with it, very much relived it. And I think one of the most popular ones is a love story with the character of Colombo. ""A Boy From New York"" is not just a fun film, it is an homage to all of those characters and of course the director is John Macy. The film in which the film is made is by the amazing and talented Cola Richey who I admire for this, giving her an amazing personality and giving Colone and the world a chance to show us that she can be a wonderful director. A special treat for Cololo fans though, is that ""Colombo"" takes the classic Colbo film one step further, not to mention the best Colbono in terms of acting and visual effects.

"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love, sometimes for the entire world, but also for individuals and groups. A growing number of people, therefore, seem content with portraying love as a kind of cosmic experience, at first very strange, then intriguing, and now as it's deeply embedded into society. In my view, both the historical and modern approaches to love have created an important lesson that goes nowhere without a great deal of explanation, a lesson which may also make us feel more real about our loved ones, as far as regards our attitudes and beliefs towards one another. We need to learn from this aspect rather than copy it (or at least re-learn to acknowledge it), and from that perspective we owe it to ourselves to live with love throughout a time when there are significant obstacles to understanding it, even at the cultural level. As a matter of fact, the story is quite well told, it does justice to its characters, though the film is highly polished and has a strong historical significance for many of the characters in question. That this is especially true for those who believe it is indeed a deeply personal relationship that can be taken seriously, is remarkable. I am especially proud of these comments made by a number upon the other side of Europe, particularly in the West with regard to their love for one's own homeland",jsd_beta1,2.760265350341797,5.934289932250977
Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism in the cinema, the movie plays out with incredible skill, with all kinds of twists and turns, a fantastic score written by director Martin Scorsese, and with fantastic cinematography by the excellent James Brown, making this an incredibly fascinating film. The only catch here is that it was a long way from being released at a release. It is an exciting, complex, intelligent, touching movie, well worth seeing if you're a fan of the film itself, or if it's just you who want to see a powerful statement about the way we treat ourselves. I must definitely recommend this film to anyone else looking for some realistic human interaction with the human body and the people around us. If you are unfamiliar with this wonderful, deeply disturbing film, you will find every facet of this movie to be completely different. My favorite parts to watch are the scenes where people walk into an room and they all look at each other, talking and getting along. We all know that this is a great cinematic experience, so I highly recommend that anyone looking to understand and understand human psychology, how emotion works, who doesn't react to people, can't understand the nature of human emotions, because it is completely unlike movies, like that which is so much more accessible to everyone who is still in diapers",jsd_beta1,2.835451602935791,5.934289932250977

(implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious enough in a '80s fashion. The film then moves to a more realistic, almost-progressive form where there's much more action, nudity, and sex between these female characters (of all people, it's rare to find a film that would include all three in an hour), and this makes for an engrossing look at the real-life interactions between them. All the supporting actors make wonderfully beautiful appearances as well, with Helen Hunt and Jack Black taking very strong roles, giving a convincing performance as the mysterious ""mad doctor."" The end result is, amazingly, an enjoyable viewing on two channels.<br /><br />As a result, I can safely say that all my friends will find it a worthy investment, in my view, as it is a much-loved movie. And one will also say it was a brilliant move to feature, because of the music and photography, which provide the sense of depth that the '60s made music.

I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films, but I was struck by how different the modern horror and the fantasy genre are today, partly due to the advances made by the movie industry (particularly by its creator, Stanley Kubrick, who became a major influence in movie culture), and partly thanks to a huge variety of filmmakers who have been on the prowl to produce a new style of horror (as well as to make good films like ""Odd Couple"" and ""Cats on a Plane"", both of which were well-made and very successful) for a long time. I have seen quite a bit of old-style Spook films. This period is one of them, with a couple of new horror classics I had a hand in and which I loved dearly. ""A Clockwork Orange"" just oozes something special. The sets are stunning and look amazing. And though the tone is definitely spooky it is never overly intense, either (because the first time I saw it I hated it), it never feels like having one-dimensional horror, and I can happily say that I am a big Batman fan, so I will watch it more than once, even though it's a well known story, which is usually very hard to find nowadays.

And for that I have to say, this film is a major embarrassment to many. Yet it is an extremely well made film, and yet still remains so relevant to a wider audience. The main character is young, handsome and smart, we also find ourselves in the midst of an intellectual crisis, a world of uncertainty; all set against the backdrop of a seemingly endless cycle of events. It takes time to get it right, yet I was able to watch it because I had the courage to tell my son, who is autistic himself, that my brother and my sister saw it in front of us.

Meanwhile, her family are torn between leaving her children with a stranger (Dolph Borgnine) and feeling guilty that she can't make them enjoy sports.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a girl named Julie (Linda Heche) goes to a soccer team and the coach, Michael (Christopher Walken) wants to bring her back into the game to improve the team.

Later that year, after they run afoul of authorities, drag queen Jessica Valenti (Diana Ross) begins performing oral oral mutilation of her fetuses and proceeds to perform it all off camera. She goes on to film two more films which have inspired a cult following. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast has had none of it. Valentini's performance isn't as convincing as her performances make her appear in many of these films and she can't really sing. Although she sings some great songs, this one is basically nothing to do. This film is far too choppy, predictable and badly miscast.

I remember that it only took five martial artists to create the epic action sequences and a third to find an actual martial system in which to live.<br /><br />And then, as with all real martial art flicks, the action really takes place during the opening moments of the movie, in the real, gritty Hong Kong streets where the main character (played by a different star, who we see only once, later gets a bit too hot) has just murdered his friend, whose identity is not revealed right away. From what we gathered thus far, this is exactly the sort of movie I would have liked if it were released here in America. The story's setting is such a gritty urban life in Asia, at the time of this film's release in Hong Kwan, even though there are few characters besides this hero, his mother, and the police. It is about twenty five years since we first see the heroine, while in reality we were the ones who gave her the courage, to go undercover and kill anyone, especially her younger brother and brother-in-law.<citation needed] When I saw the film I actually had the good feeling that this, among those movies, is possibly the most realistic martial/japanese one I have ever seen",sft,2.459242343902588,5.829436302185059

In addition to this, many other movies make me want to throw ""honey with cheese!"" at the bottom of my throat.<b />Now let me say that if this was your first movie, you would like this one.",sft,-2.6614155769348145,5.829436302185059
"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love, and in many cases enjoyed them. However, the book of life is still a work in progress. A novel about loneliness and loneliness's place in the living experience is only a very small window into what it is like to live with loneliness.",sft,2.300807476043701,5.829436302185059
Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism are not included in this story. The real problem with this movie is that the ""female"" (or ""male"") characters are depicted as victims, not as rapists. This movie doesn't make any attempt to make the male characters ""respectable"" because they're portrayed as villains. If you have ever encountered a rapist then you will find this a very difficult film to accept, but if you do then this is not too far off. I highly recommend this to all male, and female, survivors of sexual assault. Please do not make one of these films into a joke, don't rent it, or rent this film. It will be painful to watch, you'll get sick, tired, sad... just stop watching it and do something else.",sft,-0.487389326095581,5.829436302185059
"The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious","The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious and I am glad my sister and her friends and co-workers thought she was funny but it was a little over the top for the most part. (The director who wrote the movie actually didn't really care about the plot to begin with and has a great job of illustrating it perfectly and having scenes with Meg and his girlfriend do the same thing is great and was interesting.)<br /><br />My son was also very enthusiastic about this movie. He was at the last minute thinking that his parents would approve of it.<br/>< br />I recommend it even if you don't like the story. It is very original. Even a few scenes from it may seem unrealistic so far. You will not regret seeing this film for what it is. I know they are very excited about it. If you look deep into their minds they will see a complete piece of concept and that is really the whole point of the film.< br /]",sft,2.520634174346924,5.829436302185059
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films...the way they're put together, it's just really dull. I found myself with a terrible sense of wonder at just how bad it even got. Every single scene that you see has someone on the hood with it on. It's like a movie with no one behind you...even a couple.<br /><br />""Cocktails"" was the third movie in the trilogy to feature Mr. and Mrs. Claus. Although it was a sequel...they're still doing a better job here on C.S.",sft,-2.8542943000793457,5.829436302185059
"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even","The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even more. Yet, seeing it in late afternoon late night television, and viewing it on a high school TV, was a real pleasure. How else could I tell you that it was entertaining? <br /><br />The film begins with some serious philosophical and/or emotional problems. Then we get to the beginning point, which is the man who makes the most sense of his situation. You can guess the first sentence because the film starts off really smart. The man is trying to find out who he is, how he was able to make such a profound and important decision. He doesn't find it that way, but instead, he finds a way to solve the problems that he believes are his own by choosing to live a more meaningful life. In other words, after his mother died his father would come home and live with him. But, not only did his dad choose the life he wanted to have, his life became a complete fulfillment of himself, who in turn moved to Los Angeles to be with his stepmother. All through the rest of the movie the young man asks himself all sorts of questions to try to decide if he wishes to fulfill his destiny with someone else. If he ends up being a hero, then it's because he loves to ask the right questions",sft,1.7532377243041992,5.829436302185059
