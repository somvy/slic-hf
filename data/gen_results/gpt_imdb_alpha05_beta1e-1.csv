"By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's `Encounters of the Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic `A Better Tomorrow', `Zu Warriors' and the classic `Mr Vampire'","By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's `Encounters of the Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic `A Better Tomorrow', `Zu Warriors' and the classic `Mr Vampire' Hong Chan Mon (Shocking and terrifying Hong Xian). And it had also given me The Muppet Movie, the cult favourite film of 1987. But as the film progressed it became increasingly difficult to say when the films would show themselves. There was no easy way of knowing when and where they were going to come from and this was one of Hong's greatest challenges to this film. Unfortunately in 1989, director Guo-Yin Chen decided that his films didn't look so great anymore because of these problems. They looked like they had been made in Hong Wan. It was not until early 1990 that Chinese directors began creating their own films at the peak of their popularity and I am not sure whether or not this trend would continue in China because these were not enough movies to sustain Hong Wans fame. I think 'Shrek' is certainly one example, but it needed to be made for audiences to appreciate this movie and there was quite a bit of talent in that. So after the 'Rise of Shrek', the cast of 'Dracula' (1990) and `Blood and Blood and The Bloody Bride' started to show up in great numbers. The movie took on a certain amount of interest because it was the same concept but this time they added a touch"
"If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl","If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl. The plot involves the ghost of a man who was the wife of Annie's dad, a police captain, who died during a night raid on the house of the boy's parents, the old men at the back, Annie, Pierce and Eddy, some friends who are friends at school and a big neighbor who loves his dad. I just thought I had seen enough Grey O' Owl movies to know that there's more than one type of plot. Annie goes to a hospital for the night, where some other ghosts are getting their bearings, then she makes a quick getaway for school while her brother is still a kid, he gets chased by the bad guys, has a vision in which the dead man is moving around and then disappears from the picture. There was lots of action, I believe it was a very dark movie with really gruesome murders, there are more deaths than you would expect. It all makes you want to go to bed before the time ends and sleep on it. Every single night before bedtime in the middle of winter in Chicago, we watch Annie go into sleep, it is quite obvious that she is having nightmares and being eaten by ghosts. Another thing that I didn't like was that the only mention of evil was when Annie walks out of hell,"
"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards from the pearly gates of capitalism, so much so that to this day, we've seen a series of films like those, where the characters in all these films have not only personal relationships with their rich neighbours but are constantly on the lookout for hidden treasures. How this film achieves such a huge success with its cinematography is almost beyond me at times, but the cinematographer, director, film producer and production designer Pierre Sauter seems to have achieved something unprecedented in the development of his film making efforts.<br /><br />""Whirling Dukes"" is an interesting little film. It is shot in beautiful cinemas in France from 1972 to 1974 (some of its sets were also shot at the Leicestershire Studios) where its effects were largely filmed in colour. Although this is in English, some of these shots were shot with black and white, which gave ""Aunt Jean et une Terre"" an excellent feel to it, and especially in its use of black camera-work, with a strong emphasis on natural colour and colour combinations which make this an incredible film with excellent effects. Unfortunately, this may have more to do with Sault Ste Marie, a film I never really understood. One of Souders finest scenes is his dramatic final look"
Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made,"Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. There is a lot going on to be interesting in this movie. For an average person, or for a horror movie buff such as me myself. The story is about this young boy who has left his mother's house with him to find a better life, and now he wants to join the army, at age 25. He then meets the girl at the train station where he meets his father. Now he's an infantry member that is sent out to fight alongside soldiers for the British Army in Africa in WWI, where they fight against the Germans in a major battle.<br /><br />The film has a very gritty look to it. It is all true to life and true, well done, there are some really unique scenes in one scene. If the story of Soldiers and Soldiers Two could also be described as such, I will not tell you the ending though. This movie is filled with great action, great cinematography for both action and cinematography. As far as the music is concerned there is not a bad track to go through. All the sets are perfect and a beautiful scenery is captured and presented. In fact, in terms of music they sound beautiful, the effects are quite fantastic, it's a true film experience at it is simply awe inspiring."
"I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE","I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABEAST. The idea of making a film with one hundred lines of dialogue to the next is a great story and the acting is top class. If we compare ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Holly Jolly"" to see what a masterpiece this is in, it's all different, but what I really liked about this movie though is how it has something to offer a whole new world to us. I hope that this review will be helpful in helping to educate kids on all of the wonderful things the British have to do to make a beautiful film.<br /><br />The cast is excellent. Alan Cumming as the famous London mayor of Hong Kong has an amazing talent and he looks magnificent as he plays a city politician, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is superb as himself, the film makes you appreciate the whole concept of a person becoming a politician and making love to every person and their character and then being able to live the love and friendship between them as you would have in a real conversation of love, conflict and war and of course our characters also being extremely likable characters, especially in the role of Anne Rice. When we are in love we simply say ""I love you, Anne"" very simply and as an ending I love Anne as much as I will forever love her because"
"* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality ","* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality!!!!.<br /><br />If you feel cheated by the fact that both 'Gangnam Style' and 'South Park' are essentially about gangsters and revenge then you should skip both to the end of this series. In South Park we have to see both characters in an original way (see how two 'Kongsongs' can be combined? and how the two are so alike??) to understand this. <br/><b) In this episode (with the missing two scenes), a female 'Girl' escapes, then the gangster is out of town, and the Gangster starts to hunt the 'Boy' down from the town. And, how did this go so well for them? i'll not go into the details for the uninitiated, the story is just as nonsensical as the first one. It was a very silly scene for a TV episode,and the actors were in fine form,the only thing missing was the sound track.<br *brick*) However, some reviewers have not said anything really concerning the plot (I assume they didn't want to put as much substance on that!)"
This is a really fun movie,"This is a really fun movie. It is really enjoyable to see a movie that has not just the acting but also the direction. The film is based around three college students that are studying art to get a sense of the city and what it is like outside their apartment. This story is told in a very realistic way. There really would not have been enough depth in the story to really see how the characters were drawn. Also not so much on the character of a character is revealed. <br /><br />The movie takes place three years after the first movie because this was a family trip and not a school trip. My wife and I found a little bit about this movie very upsetting because we know the main character isn't a great writer and is very uneducated as to what is real life, I felt that this film would be very interesting and we could see the same character very seriously which is why it seemed so appealing to me.<br/><BR />In addition to the wonderful art of this young city, it seems to go on forever. I was very impressed with the casting of some of our cast members as well. One of them was absolutely gorgeous as a young girl who happens to be from a small town and as soon as she sees this town she will just adore it! A nice"
Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues,"Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues, who claim she's nothing more than a pawn in a long game being voted off the table by a few friends she is friends with, (Robert Mitchum). A new love love, with the support of her 'friend' (David Blaine) and her fellow ex-girlfriend, Juliette (Anna Kendrick), who also plays the new fiancé of Carlia herself, comes to London to help her husband deal with his impending divorce. However, one night, when Julietle is having trouble sleeping, she falls for the handsome and 'tasteful' brunette, Paul O'Connor (Kevin Bacon), on the advice of a handsome gentleman, Carli (Jennifer Lawrence), and is at ease. But the friendship between O and Juliettes doesn't last long, as Carlli runs a ruthless 'party line' with a 'bitch', (Michael Keaton), demanding O get naked. This 'love' is soon turned upside down when a hit man (Christopher Walken) murders the 'new girlfriend', Caroline, whose corpse is found inside and the murder is just as brutal as the previous killer. Meanwhile, Caroline's 'girlfriend' doesn, too, and just how they can love one another depends on whom you're dating. The young and beautiful Caroline"
"When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure","When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure even by the highest ranks of Hollywood.<br /><br />The best way, as I have personally written, to compare it to the ""Lucky Ones"" ""The Haunter"" or ""Sleeping Dead"" movie is to see several different, yet totally different stories (one of them being the one in which the character is played by Robert Downey Jr.).<br/><strongly suggest not only are these movies good, but that they have been created to be taken seriously. They are just as good or better than the big names such as ""House of Cards"", ""Arrested Development"", et al. and are actually very well done.<b />In addition to making these films look great and exciting (even though they are the ones that are usually associated with the genre), and being a truly awful horror film to say the least, these three films all do a rather good job of blending various genres into their respective narratives, and the overall effect is that this has more than enough excitement to make up for the lack of suspense, especially for those who do not identify with genre at all.<citation needed). To further illustrate, take one of the scenes in this movie in one big way! When one hears horror tales of ""curse"","
"Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions)","Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions) to become one of my favorite films in history, much better with better special effects (such as the fact that no actors are ever used to look like their normal versions, in fact they all look just like standard American American characters), with so much beautiful, dramatic scenes. And the scenes between Anna and her sister (a nice little young actress who seems to have lost touch with reality) are so real, and they actually feel real (see ""The Kiss""), that it was quite possibly the last time I'd seen the old English versions of Anna, but I'm glad that the New Orleans MGM made it official (for all you Brits out there), and I got to see the two-film version after seeing the Japanese version in early 1939 in which the main characters are again not very young, which only makes it an instant treat! My rating is 15 for this film, so no I don't have a specific idea how many, how long it is, what the actual age was, or just what was really happening in each scene. But if you've seen or are experiencing the original, you should definitely check out this movie. This is NOT the perfect film to catch a glimpse of real life and live life in the USA (except for one), but this is the"
"Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls""","Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls"" at the Brooklyn Hilton. When the queens leave their ball-bearing seats and try to dance the ball in the middle of the show, the drag queen tells the stage manager a very shocking tale about how she saw the white drag legend's ""little"" white family for ""big"" and ""small"" in her house in Harlem before she left. The story has plenty of symbolism, especially the dancing in one scene where Ritz Carlton is asked to put on a show and he shows off his bare shoulders, ""I'm a little girl."" In the same scene he dances at a disco and as his mother comes home she is told to dress with him in all her clothes, so as to be able to look at himself in a woman's clothes. Finally when the girl takes the subway home after getting out from her night club and stops at her place to see what a great deal she had in store for her, someone remarks on the absurdity of trying to drag people and then she's asked by her mother why she didn't go up to get it, just to the surprise of everyone, it was just as stupid as this other conversation is of course. She tries to explain all the jokes and the people are just making them up from the audience because she must be stupid and not"
I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals,"I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals.<br /><br />Overall, this film is a total bummer and should not be missed. The story is set in 1950s Britain and there are some very beautiful scenes with beautiful shots of locations taken in the hills of France. It would take the makers of this work a while to bring about some lasting insight into the setting and atmosphere of a story about racism and the need for love and friendship.<b />I am in tears during the film, but I hope this isn't just one film from the 70s. I'd like to know if any of the director/writer(s) worked on this or have worked in a major European film.<p><span class=""miller"" />First of all, the music of these two directors must have been used very well!!!

"If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie","If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie made from the perspective of a black man or black woman, or someone from a poor background. The movie starts by a group of boys on the run from an evil boss(who is also white) and his henchmen who were caught on camera by the white cops. It also has two groups of girls and then a little boy from another group who is played brilliantly, but it also starts off with a bad girl who goes to a police academy and ends up in a jail cell where a gang of thugs get arrested after an attempted robbery. In the movie, we see the gang start out looking like the stereotypical mobsters. With the police finally turning the cops into thugs, one of the thugs gets captured and is framed by them. I mean, come on, that's not gangbusters at all and a mobster looks like a real white guy. Instead of being gangbanged thugs these cops are thugs with gangsters around them and that is, like, the film is almost completely about gang behavior because all of them are looking just like that guy and the black guys look like they have been gang hit in the head by someone who has seen the last of their gang mates. They look a lot like their black guy mates but they're not like all their hoods"

Well, it gets a few good points, but to start with it's obviously a lot of material. First it contains a list of new episodes from Star Trek to The Next Generation. We have a great deal of flashbacks, so that also makes this part of the show less of a puzzle and more of an activity. For those not familiar with the series, the events and events unfold in the episode ""Time of Future"".<br #2 <br _ _]1. The Enterprise (Star Trek: First Contact) starts ""On End"" in this sequence.

"After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth","After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth! It is one of the most intense and suspenseful martial art movies I have ever seen and it would probably be remembered by any viewer for years to come. The fighting sequences are just incredible and this one also was a huge success and I've since seen it again over and over again and am sure a new fan will enjoy watching this masterpiece in a much larger scale. Not only the artistry by the artists is top notch as well as the acting is even outstanding as was the case with each of them! The score is great as there is no doubt in my mind that this was once a martial artist that was famous at the time! And the special effects are even the best of this masterly film. And I'd even say that the sound was fantastic as it was completely out of tune with the dubbing and editing by legendary martial artists! My rating is 8/10 with all of it being one great martial martial epic film with a great cast!

But after the finale, which is very touching and dramatic, his dad was still very much alive.<br /><br />When you consider the ending, or the last scenes in the film, you must think that this was a great finale for both of them. I can really see how it wasn't a coincidence the movie ends and this is the end of it all.<BELOW SPOILERS ENDING!!

i loved this movie,i loved this movie and I will never know what to make of this film's ending. I love to see what happens after such a bad movie. When I get back to my theater I've just had a few moments of self-assured delight (it seems they weren't expecting to leave) and a lovely little performance. A true gem on film.
"The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff","The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff with an agenda. I would also like to be able to say that my friends did not like this movie until the moment that it first appeared on the IMDb. At the time, it was a must see that I had seen and liked many of the other films in the ""Fargo"" series. Now, I'm no Richard Ault enthusiast and I do not agree that there is ANY reason to even have seen it. So, while I have enjoyed many Se7ens, the original ""Freaky Ways"" made a lot of changes as well as rehashed some of those original ideas. The story line of these movies was fairly weak as is what seems to have been the main reason for the changes.<br /><br />The story is as follows: In 1952, William Travolta (Ethan Hawke) lives out his life as an insurance salesman in an all-nighter and suddenly realizes that his dreams of a better future aren't going to get him anywhere. To his surprise and his great shock, this millionaire brother John, a well-versed salesman and a devoted lover, decides to make it his goal to build an atomic bomb to keep a healthy population alive.<b />John has to convince his best friend and fellow salesman Frank"
"This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela","This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. We take historical facts of Venezuela and what brought them over. Many events happened during the course of a single year. These events are in stark contrast to the fact that most of them are now ignored. The only difference is that the people who are supposed to be victims of these events take the lives that have been taken in by some government officials and then are given in a manner that makes them seem as if one is going to die at some point in time. I do not think anyone can compare the story to any other film produced to date. A documentary about the events on the day events took effect is simply better for the film when it deals with current events and real events. As for those who can only think of two things: 1. that there is no reason why Chavez must choose a course, 2. because the government must destroy it if it cannot be destroyed, and 3. Chavez has no right to a power of his own. So it just seems absurd that he can choose to direct our lives as one has to choose between two different worlds. And this was the message of this film.<br /><br />After all, it is an examination of what actually happened on this day in Venezuela's history, not a criticism of those events as they happened."

This is one of the best Bollywood movies i have seen up until now,"This is one of the best Bollywood movies i have seen up until now. I never saw Burt Bacharach in a film like this before! <br /><br />And when I say Bacharacha is a wonderful movie, i should really say this because i truly have no idea what would make me think of it once watching it. As far as i could tell this movie was produced by a smallish company but to my surprise i had never seen any films made by such a huge bunch of talented individuals on such an amazing stage!<br/><BR />The story is actually very interesting, the characters are incredibly intelligent and charismatic, and the main character's story comes off well! In one aspect a guy falls in love with an Asian boy and they end up together. They fall in with each other but then later that day two old boys begin to fall out but the girl falls for a man who would later grow up much better. In the end they fall and have romantic feelings for eachother, their love for one another is still strong, even after this their affection is reciprocated by one other man for some time. <Brilliant portrayal of Bajrang Dal as an ancient Hindu sect and a powerful leader; the movie is so powerful and compelling that i loved it!

"This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments","This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments. My favorite of these is when a woman runs away from a dangerous man and finds her husband is dead. In this episode he is chased and killed by his girlfriend who is missing when he gets to his bed. Another great moment occurs when we see the dead woman carrying her cat in it's arms across the house in front of him and we wonder if these ghosts are a result of her body falling into the hands of one or another killer. This is what inspired the story to get this feature on syndication.<br /><br />This episode was made possible by the help of Michael Jordan and he really shines in his role as ""Homer"". We have to mention, the episode also provides a wonderful storyline which all of us will remember fondly. One of my favorite things about this show is the fact it never has to rely on the ""big"" shows like The Simpsons or CBS World. The storyline was developed from several conversations and by my own personal knowledge this has been one the most enjoyable show in television history. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys the quirky side of TV that loves TV shows."
Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen with a special effects film. From that moment we remember all of their stories -- fairy tale stories, dragons, demons, ghosts, a mad witch and a group of other creatures. The film also touches on all the issues of war, survival, love, redemption, forgiveness, etc., all throughout. And finally these stories must be told in very difficult situations. What was the point? This special effect production is the perfect example of how Disney would show us the fairy stories. We have to go deeper into it just to know what stories told to these characters, but at the same time it's also an extremely intelligent way of telling the story. In this film we must learn how to live and to love while we fight this evil. This means keeping the right background and knowing the importance of understanding, respect and how it affects both the characters.<br /><br />The special abilities are outstanding. Disney created the monster with everything from the sound effects to sound editing to adding special musical voices to achieve the effects of our heroes and villains.<blockquote type=""center"" />This film is definitely a masterpiece and I believe it contains over forty fairy scenes. There are so many more that show some really amazing story lines. I am very fascinated to see all Disney productions before it is"

Watching the movie it reminded me a lot of the film. There wasn't so much dialogue and I was watching Shakespeare as I expected it to. This is one I had been praying for before seeing it so I know I would be praying the same way in the end. It is, however, worth seeing and knowing that I will enjoy it immensely over the many many years to come."
"When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987)","When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987) and ""Killer Instinct"". Although the acting is fantastic, it is all of the actors playing the roles to perfection. Not the least of which is the cast of some of these film makers. A true treasure of Irish cinema."
"I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban","I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban. There's a scene where they are being interviewed about the same subject, the main question being ""What do you see""? The script is totally fake. I can tell the scriptwriters are expecting a man to tell how to fly, what to say, how a woman is supposed to act, etc. And the film is all over the place in almost every way, in fact every scene has the use of special effects that don't exist in the genre. You could tell when an action scene happens and when the camera has been set so perfectly that the action just does nothing. A film that is based on the best known SF novel is like a hit-piece that only gets better through better acting by a superior cast. <br /><br />As far as the story goes, it's all very simple, very typical Hollywood. It's basically a tale of two brothers, one of them an engineer, who have built a spaceship, while the other has a girlfriend who goes to university. The story is set in what is basically an isolated neighborhood between the two of these brothers. When the astronaut tells his sister of his girlfriend's love, his brother takes the spaceship away, leaves his daughter and tries to get the girl's boyfriend back, but when someone calls and shows"

You're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse,"You're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse than the original!<br /><br />The acting by the new characters of this film is horrible. There are many bad lines and scenes of rape that I've never seen or seen directed by a decent person. The most shocking scene that i had ever seen and this includes no more than nine scenes in the entire movie! I mean it can't even be called a film! The way the acting is done is absolutely ridiculous. No one is made to look intelligent, intelligent or even intelligent by having any plot. I can tell you there is not any dialog or story with any character that is even remotely believable. All the people are completely devoid of the subtlety that makes the characters the perfect plot devices with the plot being no different from anything else on film. When someone says ""Hey, watch this movie like you've seen it before!"" the whole audience instantly assumes that something is amiss. <br/><b)This is one of those movies I never would want to ever see again. It's a movie that will always be remembered for that good time, but will never even get a chance to get back on track. If you watched the movie last night at the very last moment, it is your life."
To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made,"To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made - and this is by far the finest of its era"".<br /><br />There are two basic reasons to view this film. Firstly, I would like to say that the film deals with the concept of suicide. While it does deal with this as a social issue at least it also deals in other issues which arise in society and relate to suicide.<br/>< br />Secondly, this movie deals specifically with suicide awareness, one of which is the suicide crisis. Suicide is one which can take many forms. Many people suffer with depression, which it should never happen in the first place. The film itself deals extensively with social and physical issues such as suicide, suicidal behaviour and suicidal thoughts. As such the movie is an excellent way a person reacts when confronted with a suicide attempt in person. It even discusses issues of self esteem and personal issues about suicide and coping skills. I personally have dealt with stress such incidents of over coping and the way in which people deal in their behaviour to help cope with life and death situations. In my opinion this documentary has to be viewed as the classic case study of the struggle within an emotionally wounded individual and how a relationship can lead to the realization of this. You should go see it with friends as you will learn from it how to deal"
"I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth","I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth. The story focuses on what makes someone a bad person--somehow in spite of that, not everything works out for them.<br /><br />A girl walks through the woods one day in an early morning and finds something in her bedroom that turns out to be real--a young girl who knows the young guy in real life from just the video game. However, the boy's mom, a mother figure, doesn't think that it's really a big deal to her as much as they'd expect. And she believes that the girl should tell her own story, telling her father one of her dreams to tell his stories.<br - end of comments--<BR />The film deals with a couple of people who were not like other people--these young kids, with their mother and this whole'mystic' character, was completely unlike any other child I know at the time. This kind of story was supposed to make my heart go 'Oh, no no' and my face turn pale; and these two kids really did nothing to advance the plot or take it further, as I would have expected from a child of the 1950's. As for me, who isn't a huge fan of this movie, I like a good 80's movie that isn"
"I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do","I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do. I enjoyed its storyline, characters, theme song and songs, the performances of great actors, great direction and directing: Bill Paxton, Paul Haggis and John Huston are superb. Even though it was the first movie of the era, I think there are many good reasons why I love it now.<br /><br />The characters are great! This movie also is one of those movies where I watch it again and again through rewrites or whatever else I don't understand! My wife and I have seen plenty of movies with their good characters on their side. This one is an absolute must have for all lovers of actors and actresses."
This is a brilliant political satire,"This is a brilliant political satire that gives political commentaries a fresh air in the modern era. It is very refreshing, entertaining and enjoyable to see a political debate being fought on a very old American scale. At 7/5, you will be able to recognize the similarities which exist between this movie and other films which have done it for other political parties in recent years such as: The Nixon Effect, The Vietnam War and the Reagan and Bush decisions."
You play as B,"You play as Burt Reynolds in this very funny role. The film also happens to be about two young lovers who, having no idea they are going to get married, get a really messed up letter signed by Reynolds. Both of these young people were able to understand that they would not marry until a very VERY VERY HIGH TIME.<br /><br />The film plays out at a fairly standard middle age movie where we meet the characters(especially Bo Derek) and have some close ups of their faces as they try to explain things that are really awkward to me. I have seen a couple of movies where this happens pretty prominently in both movies. In this movie, it takes the viewer a VERY long time to realize that the couple and their marriage have already been formed. That makes the movie quite funny in a way that few movies actually deal with. For example, the scene with the baby watching the video chatroom and the mom talking about how it is OK to let her grow up in your family, and how the film was a ""drama"", is actually pretty interesting and I can appreciate a little that ""humor"" has not been used to justify this way of storytelling since we do get to see Bo's mom and talk about the ""romance"" that's happened. Again, this"
This film caught me by surprise,"This film caught me by surprise. I thought ""I'll see it on DVD."" and that is exactly what I did! The acting was superb... the directing was very good, the script was good and the direction very well crafted!!! The storyline felt like you would not expect so often from an old horror film but I guess this film definitely helped, especially for those who have not experienced a modern horror movie. The film is very fast paced, suspenseful and makes you want to walk away with a full head on your head horror story. You might be disappointed by the performance by Mark-Paul Sorvino but he did a very real job, and I cannot thank him enough. Mark is always likable, I think he was more than a little intimidating. He does his stuff well, he has an extremely believable character to himself and he is one of the best actors of all time, one who makes a good living out of his role! His character development was also great, his acting skills are superb and you can really understand where his frustration is coming from. Even by today's standards, when a horror flick is released, horror fans will love it! Mark also has his good buddy Mr. Gogol on to explain what makes his movies special, which is great as well. A perfect compliment"
I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival, which was a highlight of this month's Film Society. This movie is very well made and a great viewing experience for me--it's a documentary on the movie and there are wonderful visual sequences that truly remind people of their films. I can't say enough about the production values and production value of a film, although it is an award winning film. The photography, photography and the storyline and photography are the heart of the story, and it makes the characters so powerful.<br /><br />The writing, acting, sound effects and set design of each film are top notch, as well as being quite special. Most films I've seen with Tom Hoeken have a very good ensemble cast that has been a staple in the film making world. And the cast also includes David Harbour, Stephen Chow and John Travolta as the villains and antagonists who act out the stories. Additionally, the soundtrack and story is absolutely stunning, along with excellent sound recording and orchestral score.<embracing Tom, Tom and Linda the wise and wise man of Maryland and Virginia, this film can be enjoyed in any capacity with any mood or interest, even in a quiet movie. Definitely recommended!"
THE JIST: See something else,"THE JIST: See something else? Maybe you can't get the JST-DVD to find your DVD player. This is an excellent DVD to watch by any number of the best producers. The script and editing is just beautiful and the music is excellent. It took the effort of most of us filmmakers and filmmakers to get to the level of that movie without becoming a pain in the butt and being the next film to Hollywood. There are many factors which put these talented people in place. Every little detail is perfect for each individual. I am happy that David Suchet came out with the screenplay. Everyone should see ""Kane's Last Words"" when they start seeing it but the director needed to do this. David was able to create a complex and moving story and make it a well thought out movie. As a result David went to a place that never got any better. John Waters makes sure everything has gone through the motions so everything is flawless. He does his best to combine the elements of a great story into beautiful music. Not only is this a must see film, it is the only film that you will see on DVD for any occasion. If you know your favorite film about movies and have the ""B"" or ""C"" in your name then you may love this masterpiece."
"Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank","Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank. I'm glad that so many people could see the similarities. What I wanted to see was a very moving, touching story and I loved Natalie Portman giving the role of Natalie a wide berth in the film.<br /><br />The acting, by any standard, was quite good. Roberta Lange (the very beautiful Maria Juana) was believable as a woman who gets caught up with another, and also gave the character a genuine touch and beauty. The characters were the perfect combination to me. <br -4/10, 4/11"
"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way. The film has the uncanny feeling of its own creation after a mysterious event, and of course the feeling is well-enjoyable in itself.<br /><br />Now we're on to our fun, when the titans of the film discover their daughter's secret, they use her to go and spend the night and then head to New York to steal her secret. But what is this and how does it go down and who does all this killing in her lair and her mysterious surroundings? The last scene is brilliantly done and just right, with the wonderful performances by the leading actor, the great cinematography, well thought out action and good acting.<BR / BR />I recommend this to anyone looking for some of King-esque horror films. I'd recommend it, but for anyone who finds the movie entertaining, I highly recommend keeping this handy. Recommended for the kind of people who want to create their own unique horror in their bedrooms or bedrooms/racks with a few lights, lights up if their dog barked! This movie has some wonderful touches too including many of those creepy moments - especially the two main women who come in with their bodies and the scene when her house is transformed into a haunted house! Oh yeah, my boy!"
i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me,"i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me could remember it perfectly, and I was a little disappointed. I thought that the first half was great and the ending was just as great as the movie, but that was before I got to know it. First of all the film was about a girl (and a guy) whose boyfriend starts a war between the two, who are all doomed through a process called survival together as their friends and enemies come to an end, only to break through through with the help of a rescue truck (which is very well made).<br /><br />A lot of plot elements are introduced by the action scenes, the music is nicely orchestrated, it is nice to see scenes that were not always used in other films. There are three or four scenes where a woman gets stabbed in the neck and falls, then one happens when she accidentally puts her ear through the throat or when the killer stabs her during the torture of an animal, while a car suddenly goes through her head and into the car and kills her, that kind of thing happens many times, even if it didn't take place in a movie. Also we have a group of three guys at a bar, trying to get their boyfriend (who isn't really a man at all in this film) the most memorable moment is when"
"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect","The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect when you listen to it on a Saturday morning. A lot of the things were original - the theme of loneliness is not the only subject, there's also some of it in a good comedy. It definitely had some funny bits in it. Also in my list is John Galtley's character(a little creepy for people who have a touch of comedy - no doubt)who plays a very intelligent man at the end. This really is funny and I think the ending is much better than the first, however the script was more clever, and it seemed a lot better. Unfortunately the humour didn't get lost during the entire run, it actually got progressively worse in the sequel.<br /><br />Overall a really good film with a fantastic story, good performances, bad pacing..."
This is what makes me proud to be British,"This is what makes me proud to be British (though British speaking is still the best I have heard). If this film is taken down, it will never be a successful title, nor a movie I love to recommend to anyone who doesn't enjoy the same genre.<br /><br />On the flip side, despite such an extensive use of music, the only reason you will see this movie for your entertainment will be the special effects, which are just as well-made as this story. The movie is truly scary and if there is one thing you love, this is all you need to have an enjoyable day. <br - Michael Jackson"
"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today. Its story, at its heart, takes place about the same person and his feelings for another, yet he still gets to live with that situation. His character is very humanistically honest and just wants to be a doctor, without being bitter or selfish. In many ways this made this even better. Many other films have similar situations, this one of them being in A.I.Q., and I have always admired the movie for having such a good story line, with a lot of scenes of him and a great scene with the people he meets around the world. And the scene where he gets killed on the night of his wedding in one film is amazing. It takes your breath away, it's not just that it was filmed in Paris, for many years, the rest of the country was covered, almost every city in Europe was in ruins that day. The only scene in this movie was during the wedding, but I love the song with this film too, 'Ecclesiaphoria'.<br /><br />A great song for the audience, I always found a nice way to relate the emotions and the actions of human beings. Even today, people would think of it as more or less about love, which was a very different concept. All this is"
"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love, misery, the joy of life and the misery of failure.<br /><br />In this film we meet the poet, a well known figure for the most part. His poetry, however, is not only about his troubled self-discipline, as well as his difficult love life while with his family and companions, nor that the love of God is in him. I like him not just because he is different from other people such as those around him, or in a more profound way than others of his age.<Br / Image Courtesy of Sondra Arbajj"
Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism that is not yet mainstream; this is a movie that would not be made for public consumption on TV or radio unless it had a bit of a budget for a second release.<br /><br />In the end, it's a fine film for fans of dark, melodramatic, tragic and ultimately cathartic films. I think we all got the message very simply. A tragic human being can't escape it, yet this film is all about redemption. The character in this movie and in other films, the family on the rescue and not the people on death row who must endure the anguish of their loved ones in a manner that does not condemn them to the death penalty, is one of the finest human beings I've been to in the past thirty years. This film reminds us of many other classic stories."
"The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious","The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious and it showed. They both talk about their lives and how their car never gets out of gear, but in the next scene they take over the car. The movie's premise has you wondering if Meg is really the real Meg, or just a person who is getting into things and is just playing with the toys. I can't remember their names, and the ending is pretty good. Unfortunately, when they get a guy to come over and check on their cars, they are all turned on because (for the first two minutes) the lady, the girl in question and most of the staff are not the villains they portrayed in their movies. Why? The scene where it happens that Meg gets really excited and hits the pump and she gets hit off the wall is very funny, a good sign. However, this movie comes out so quickly and not enough to stick me with it. If the movie had been filmed after Supergiant 3 on The Big Chill or Supercute, then these 2 people would have the same personality, same history and maybe some more humor. Then you'd have ""Inspector."" (in a movie by name)"
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films because of the fear of being seen out in this world. They were more than funny and entertaining enough to keep me entertained throughout! I had great problems with the costumes in the films. Most of them felt overly long. A lot of parts were made entirely out of cardboard and cardboard had nothing to do with each other. I actually had difficulty finding anything on the movie table that resembled a print on an envelope in my hand and was only able to find a couple of different covers. Some scenes were very reminiscent of real life Spooks but the characters were only half as stupid as the film and the plot had no place on that scale. And the animation was very well done but it wasn't even very good. The movie itself was a little rough but I think it is worth a look for any horror fan or even just a good film. Don't give the filmmakers the credit, it's about as good as anything they have ever put out. If you like some of your favorite Spook films go ahead with A Nightmare on Elm Street - you'll like the worst of it and they were better in that respect."
"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even","The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even after its first 30 or so minutes. In this film, we are introduced to one man with a mental illness who travels to New York City to learn about his experience while traveling to his grandmother's old place. He is not at home in the big city and the only person not near him while he is walking in time is his mother who wants him to go to school in college and go home. I am not an intellectual, so I was not expecting a witty and effective satire of our characters. Rather, I expected a funny story that would explore the complex dynamics of a man trying to overcome his depression and finding his place in society. The movie is full of great moments and great sequences. There is, of course, just no ending in this movie. One of the most compelling moments as a young girl is the ending where a guy says things like his mom is just as bad as his dad, a girl with AIDS is very intelligent, and so are great friends that he keeps coming in on the occasion. At the end the girl says to her mom about her daughter she hasn't met before and when her mother says no one will have a daughter or anything like that. Some viewers, especially younger ones of this generation, may find the movie a fun surprise, not as"
