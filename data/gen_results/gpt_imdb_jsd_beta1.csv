"By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's `Encounters of the Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic `A Better Tomorrow', `Zu Warriors' and the classic `Mr Vampire'","By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's `Encounters of the Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic `A Better Tomorrow', `Zu Warriors' and the classic `Mr Vampire' -- but Hongkongers still didn't know the genre or the medium was just a series of scary film clichés, a few obscure and almost impossible to follow. In this one, the killer, whose name is played at random and never reveal in his mind, is actually a killer who kills people just by going in and killing people in the middle of a city. The other major role of Lee is an orphan girl who's an attractive and well-known actress who plays a young nun at heart who has been tortured and murdered by a crazed killer and her husband with a couple of teenage friends.<br /><br />If anything, Hong kung fu may have an element of realism or a sense of humour and it doesn't come along until the end of one minute.<Br / Images: John Wong (credited as a Japanese director)"
"If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl","If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl. I don't recommend watching this movie. Don't waste your time or money on Grey owls, they're great!!! I'm not the worst person in the world, this is another movie that proves if you can keep up with what you are in a movie and keep the focus off of it's story or situations."
"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards from the poor. The film also shows us exactly how important it is to be able to live in this country, how much we want the country to change, where we can live, what we see and what happens in the present. But all of these things are interconnected on both levels and are very different from a story, as well as from an art, a drama and a film.<br /><br />Having said all things considered, Jean-Claude Van Damme manages to portray the mood and atmosphere of rural France at the very best of his ability (with its incredible scenery, scenic landscapes and music) and this is an amazing achievement considering that it takes in France as one of its wealthiest countries. If Renaudoir had tried to show us in every way the beauty of France to the eyes and ears (as he would have done with his work) he could not have succeeded. A film like this one is not an ideal film but one that is very well done in many ways. As with every Renélès work I have had the pleasure to speak personally with, for some things the work is always good of course, but also because we all always like to see Ren's work in art form. It is the same way with this film that"
Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made,"Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made - in fact, it has made this movie the best film I have ever seen in my career. There are quite funny scenes throughout this film. The songs were by a great number of great singers such as John Waters, Miles Davis, Robert Wagner, Frank Sinatra and John Coltrane.<br /><br />There is no question in all this that there is a whole generation of very talented singers - not only to great musical styles, but also to a musical passion. This film does not disappoint. It has a wonderful story throughout and even the action scenes are spectacular."
"I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE","I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABEUS. There are many movies where people don't come to terms with the fact that they may not live with their ""normal"" life, and they also have it in common with BIBERNADOR, CHILDREN & DR. EYVEN. But this was the first ONE that was so incredibly accurate and beautifully told about the hardships of a group of people who have to travel in a large order to get themselves and their loved ones to the very end, without any emotional weight of any kind being placed on them at all. It is a wonderfully complex picture of reality for all people, from the simple, everyday to all the complicated. The very final ""point of view"" of the film was truly breathtaking and truly beautiful. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes to see those moments on film and not just to people living together."
"* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality ","* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality the movie was meant to be a good comedy, it would have been great for teen groups around the world that would be really disappointed. As a boy myself I think I have become more mature towards the younger generations by the time I saw it. <br /><br />As I watched the film the second time it hit me I realised how messed up the situation was and it really irritated me too. It brought me and my kids together at the end of this comedy and told me how I should be more than ""cool"" or ""lazy"" although it also made me a little wary of not telling his mother who he is. The whole ""shocking"" tone and ""charming"" attitude is taken from another movie by another writer (and I find these two very similar). So we get the idea that many of us are now too childless and insecure to cope with the harsh realities of our day to day lives. And that doesn't take away from the jokes this movie has a nice sense of humor and makes you laugh harder than usual.<br/>< br />There is also lots of music playing throughout the movie. I was surprised that the director thought this was one of his special feature films, because i am sure most who have seen this had"
This is a really fun movie,"This is a really fun movie to watch! As long as you're not expecting anything good, don't waste your time or money. There are quite a few plot twists here and there, but we also know who is going to run the hospital. For example, when a hospital doctor decides to let her stay, he is not sure what to do with her. A rather boring movie this time around, and certainly is worth the time.<br /><br />One of the characters in this film is one of three students from the school who are also the victims of a vicious gang rape that took place in the 1970's. These two women are in prison and the only way they make it out of prison is to stay there for a year. You don' know when it will end but you are not allowed to judge the rapists who will still go on their killing spree in a matter of days.<Br /></br>< br />The only thing that really makes this movie interesting is watching the other two characters playing out and having it all turned upside down. One is the guy who tells the girl to ""tell him what happened to him."" They're supposed to be playing that role well, even in real life, so if you've seen all the scenes they had to play, you'll probably like"
Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues,"Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues and tries to cover it up with their friendship (but they fall for the very girl she's attracted to) to keep her away from him.<br /><br />When her brother (Eric Schleider) tries blackmailing her and demanding that he pay her to marry him (because she couldn't afford to buy a house), she decides to stay with Charli (Eugene Valli) and try to get a divorce from her, but Charle is too greedy to tell her how much he has paid her in cash, and she convinces her husband to make her a part of the club, even if they are not close. <br/><BR />Chara doesn't understand a lot, she just finds out the truth that she has betrayed her beloved husband, so he refuses her. Charlie then uses that revelation to blackmail Charla towards leaving, not trusting Charlene anymore. So Charlon goes on his murderous rampage and sets off all kinds of bombs, from the police building to the church to every street, the military base to all places. He does not want to leave so the government starts to try and destroy his business with him, as all hell is raging with them! After an explosion that kills everyone in the world and takes over the"
"When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure","When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure and one of the worst films of it all, and it deserved to be condemned...a fine film, if you are into the horrors of cinema.<br /><br />This film was filmed at the turn of one century and a third of a century after the publication of Dostoyevsky's ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", and from then on it has become a major hit in film making circles worldwide and has sold, both as a new and timeless masterpiece and in popular film and television films alike. If you haven't seen the first installment and have your doubts about cinema go or watch the second, because it's actually another masterpiece.<b />A brilliant piece of work from a true master of storytelling -- it gives an excellent visual performance as well as keeping you fully invested. There are some moments in this tale that give you the creeps in that this is a film not for you - as one cannot watch it alone, so there is no need for someone else to bring the story into your home if not you. It is also incredibly well presented in the style of ""Les Miserables and Etienne"", a great blend of literary and modern films. <br/><b]Rating: * out of ****--- 8/10"
"Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions)","Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions) in comparison. It has a great story, nice sets, very high production values, and quite a bit of comedy. And a special soundtrack by Michael B. Jordan and Jeff Bridges - the latter of which may seem to be a nod towards the other two directors who produced those fantastic films.<br/><bra>As for the acting, the two actors do a very good job. Ben Kingsley makes as good a work of art as you may ever see. J.D. Salinger was a lot better in the original (although there was some brief flirting and the director tried to take a similar approach since he was quite good in his other films) and is a definite improvement over the great British director of the same name. (But I will certainly not recommend this one). There is also a good cast from various unknowns - Michael Beasley, Ben Gummer, William Hurt, Paul Dini, Jack Lemmon, John Huston, Richard Dreyfuss, Jerry Lewis and Paul Schrader. Very good performances by most of these characters are what are quite useful in this adaptation and one must look a little more closely at this original to understand what is to expect from this film.<Benedict Cumberbatch, a handsome and respected British actor has been"
"Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls""","Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls"" along the avenue, where the black boy is always caught. In this first part of the piece he is ""scared"" away by an older man who has just graduated from high school. His mother takes him to see her mother's older sister, with whom she goes to school over dinner. When her father goes away, she believes him and decides to ""do the same thing over again."" With these first steps, we never see the end of black racism. But after some of these steps we have to confront the racism of a community that has been very segregated for centuries. This film does it all. It captures the frustration of life in the South of that time. One wonders how the movie came about, but I'm sure it would have been fascinating to know more about the early life of this small white community, a small town where one could ask questions like ""who is white and who is black?"" At least for our movie we can go back to the time when one couldn't ask the question ""is black really a race?"" But once we get to that point, the film's messages reveal its underlying message. The film tries to tell the story of an African-American who became a victim to racism when his white classmates were murdered by a white friend when he"
I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals,"I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals, but it might be a decent effort.<br /><br />For those of you expecting great humor and/or clever action, avoid this movie. It's nothing like ""King of the Hill"" or ""The Evil Dead,"" it's too simple to the core. If you are not familiar with it, try not to go all out with a bunch of dead people eating each other after a fight and a giant, mutated spider. You will be stunned."
"If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie","If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie of its type. However I thought it was better than the movie that came after it and that is where this one falls into the category of ""great originality of a movie"". I was completely disappointed in how it tried to depict that the protagonist of the film is really a woman in her 30s. Even more so when they begin to think she is a bad person because she acts out of character, which she seems so unattractive for, when she starts to get into hot cars and get married, she never does.<br /><br />The story is basically over long enough to make you question the meaning of things, but I will give you the gist. If you have no idea of what happened at the beginning of this film then you, or anyone else, will go through some painful things throughout the story that you should have never seen before. I feel it's one that will cause you to want to watch something else instead so as to be able to find more information or find the pieces of information you need. It's more of an education than a crime; you spend an hour looking at a list of events just to see the most likely events at any given moment for there to have occurred in life. Of course those are only really possible on the one hand"
"You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life","You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life in the film. It starts off very weird as it becomes increasingly clear that people want Lois to kill him, but it turns into a story about her having sex with a girl. She is told that she wanted to stay and try and get Lois back and was really disappointed to lose her to another man, and had to do the killing herself to get her back for a certain amount of time.<br /><br />The end of the story tells what really happened to Lois in this film, only it does this so that we know why she left. Lois is supposed to have just met the girl who killed her and that was all that happened. There are some really bad things in ""Wonderland"", which make this movie bad and have some plot holes which I hope will never be explained in another movie as well. If someone could just tell me the plot and how many of these elements will ever be present in anything that I watch, I would love to know how it all went down. You've probably guessed what the movie says by watching the credits, since that is the only thing that makes it possible to sit down and write an entire movie about what was happening that made the worst movie imaginable. In the first ten minutes, Lois and her girlfriend are in what seems to"
"After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth","After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth (I remember only those parts that worked for me and the one that didn't) and that the action could be summed up much better, with a twist that was very clever and well known in the martial artists history. Not that it wasn't a clever twist and if you liked these two things, then I recommend this movie as a complete watch for all martial artist fans. <br /><br />1/10"
"""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life ","""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life!!! This show has great comedic potential but it is definitely not one that fans of ""The Simpsons"" love to hear because it's so funny!!! I'm glad because I loved it and was able to sit through almost all of it!! It's funny and funny enough that it has not sunk from the bottom of my seat for me to say the least!!!! I thought I was seeing this show in 1995 when I turned my TV off and then watched it again this month and watched for the first time.... My favorite thing about that episode is when Homer's mom was talking about how she thinks he's a real genius. Now, in the years that have passed I don´t think that there has been much love made between Homer and his father about what he does or just what way this crazy life is going to turn out!! Homer has no idea that he will not have to suffer the consequences of being taken care of in this life.<br /><br />Although that's one of many comments I have made I cannot express how much I LOVE ALL of these great episodes of shows and am honored to be able of sharing with you some of their stories.... This is a great show that is really for all ages, to enjoy, even to watch, it was on CBS in 1994"
i loved this movie,"i loved this movie and as his favorite character the movie was a must see. He also had no need to read a book and never got bored reading it so this proved to be good entertainment and if i could see this in my rental I would!<br /><br />The acting is good too! Tim Kibbe, a huge fan of his has gone on to do great, and he is funny!! He plays the arrogant brother and tries to get his friends off the streets so he can get away with something really bad. John Cusack is fantastic as Tim's uncle (also Tim), which adds some of Kiberman's comedy. I was expecting more from this guy! <br/>< br />Some of the actors look good for their age and the scenery is awesome! Overall a great movie that will make you laugh along with your family from the start. What can I say a lot about this flick... i recommend it for anyone that loves Tim and his story."

"This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela","This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. The main reason I like the film so much is because it is not one of Shakespeare's ""fable"" (the book is written by a Latin American writer). The documentary shows that the events occurred in a very specific and very predictable manner in order to make sense of their timing. I recommend you take the time to see the documentary on why and when their events took such a long period of time. It's worth that time period, especially for an actor who doesn't need any introduction."
This is a masterpiece footage in B/W 35mm film,"This is a masterpiece footage in B/W 35mm filmography with outstanding story line, actors, special effects, and editing that will leave you breathless for days. The cinematography, great voice-over narration, incredible special effect effects and effects at the cinematics are all here in this ""remix"", made for everyone with love of cinema and I love it even more now! From simple to brilliant film making, it delivers the perfect balance and suspense you have come to expect from 'The Matrix' as an excellent and well-crafted feature film! For those who prefer a simple yet intense story, I highly recommend this movie as I think the cast and crew make such an absolutely fantastic team, this is my very first film to really give an effort to film, in a way that is absolutely worth watching if your a fan of films so you will LOVE it! It doesn't really work as a horror film though, the visuals are fantastic, as well cinematically stunning and it is very well shot, with a very unique set of beautiful scenes that are beautifully put together and are shot in style. I believe I am the only film reviewer in UK who loves 'Matrix' so highly! This film is an absolute MUST-see in cinemas for fans of film as we need to look and feel how it might appeal to everybody"

Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen for the first time. The movies were all the classic Disney stories and the songs of Robert Wagner, a legendary songwriter that once sang ""Eager for Love"" about the plight of his beautiful princess. ""Lance in the Rain"" and ""Pillars of Fire"" are about a little girl named Dorothy who falls in love with a beautiful fairy named Belle (Beverly Hills Cop), who she later makes herself. Both of them love the princess but they have also decided to try and marry and even become friends.<br /><br />The story is great. Dorothy finds love and love of her life, much more love that she never had and more than a child (in fact), more children but that doesn't mean all of it is a happy ending. There are children and children of all ages and from an unusual setting where there are many animals and most of those animals are not human beings, they are animals. <br><""Lucky Little Bug"" is an adventure from beginning to end. When the fairy starts to think of something she loves it all up because it's so well done and she gets to know it in a much better way than any other fairy tale. This is especially when it revolves around a young girl who takes to her role"
I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it,"I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it, the musical score and of course the actors I love. My wife and I had a wonderful time watching and enjoying this magnificent piece of literature and in a highly emotional and romantic way. I would love to see it again and again, but sadly I couldn't find it until I saw it on video this week! It was perfect, in that ""saw of love"" atmosphere! I loved it to be honest! The scene where everyone was dancing together was brilliant and the scenery was stunning - great lighting, beautiful countryside with beautiful scenery and great settings, superb scenes and people dancing!<br /><br />I love seeing the cast and crew work very well together. They keep each and every aspect of the story moving very straight forward. The sets, props and costumes, even the ""magic"" ones, all of them are perfect perfect! This was one of my all night shows, and one I have never wished to do again! Great props for casting, directing, editing and production. Great cast, wonderful music, fantastic performance by Michael Green as his fiancée and wonderful actresses. Michael and his girlfriend Lisa are brilliant, so well played and acted, to perfection in their chemistry! My absolute favourite part is Lisa's and Michael's relationship with the other actors,"
"When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987)","When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987) but I really got the impression this was meant for black/white audiences as the film had a good laugh, the story and the special effects were nice and all the shots in this movie were really exciting.<br /><br />I think the first feature that I have seen that looked at this idea was ""Dark Night"", and I loved watching how they would combine everything in ""Carnivores From Beyond"". It was a bit out there for me but still a film that you could go out and see. It still felt like a masterpiece to see all you ""chick"" vampires (a fact that is one very important aspect of the plot) in and to watch ""Night in L.A."" I don't know if the director himself did ""Chick and The Chocolate Factory"" but he does it brilliantly. Overall I highly recommend this video for any ""entertainment"" fan that can't take ""dark"" movies seriously. This is the best vampire films on the planet and is a must see for all vampire fans. Highly recommended!!"
"I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban","I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban, but after seeing it as a young man, I don't feel any pity for the poor black youth trying to make the most of it: It made me laugh. I was very proud of that moment... A moment after it aired on Sunday night on Fox, the people I loved loved it--not a white woman in America and not the rich kid on 'The Voice.'<br /><br />I just hope the country will continue to accept non-white children and adults in schools and colleges, so when they look down their nose at their children, we can begin doing away with racism in that society.<br/><BR />My son and I are all raised in the '80s and can attest to the fact that the Black-American community has an unending hatred of all Caucasians, with our prejudice. We would much love to see us be a part of a great generation of artists! We have a proud African heritage, which is also a reason why we have so many friends all over the universe. The White-White-I-Am-So-Black Foundation just started today, along with thousands of other organizations and organizations, to support students of race. My family too does not want the hate of the Afro-Saxon prejudice on"

I enjoyed the concept and the acting and it was just a pleasure watching it, I can't say that it surprised me that so many people came up with this movie... I know this is a movie for kids, but the general idea of kids having sex with one another was interesting. It was funny, the kids were in there, no violence or anything interesting, just normal children. <br/><><btw, this could very well be the final movie of my favorite movie, since i love The King of Queens.<br -dontwatch"
You're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse,"You're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse than it was a year ago...""<br /><br /><Bridget Siegel, who had a wonderful career in her native England playing a kind and honest old wife, died in a long plane crash. It was reported she had been taking medicine in hospitals and they treated her with all sorts of herbal preparations.<br/>< br />When there was yet another plane shot down by the Japanese on June 7th 1941, the Royal Air Force brought out all the wounded and the British came to help. They landed on the island where a plane crashed, and had its main victim. This film, ""The Dreamland"" has the legend of how men went off to battle, including fighting for the world's greatest war heroes. To me and many others, it seemed unbelievable, an exaggeration that made little sense. I'm glad they chose film to cover their war stories. Great films with legend and legend do have a certain place in history, but they're a great medium to go out and share a true tale. By honoring the bravery of our soldiers and protecting their lives in battle we are really making this film a tribute of bravery not only all over the World, from the American side."
To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made,"To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made for that particular genre. It's very original, engaging, moving, and really just beautifully executed. You get to find out the truth about how a young person is able to live a life just like that of John Waters - a film that will give the reader absolutely no comfort whatsoever. The story of this particular film, which has a very different and very clever twist, is an all around excellent introduction to the whole of a fascinating story about a man's struggle to make the perfect living, through adversity, adversity and love alone. A film based on the real life experiences of all those involved, who have experienced the hardships, triumphs, hardships and pain of being a human and not someone else. Truly brilliant."
"I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth","I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth when compared to the others I've just mentioned (it takes two years or so that makes it really worthwhile), but I don't think its a very bad film.<br /><br />Its not so bad that the ending is, at first, fairly predictable and the opening scene, when the two leads' face being eaten by a monster, was quite gripping. What it doesn't have though is any really nice scenes, either.<b />Its okay that its pretty slow, especially for a movie of this stature. It was one of the first movie I saw in my life where the story line seemed to be moving and a really good ending almost. There is an excellent sound track especially during the very first half minute where you start to enjoy a little more how the monsters have moved. The music is pretty great and it has two great songs for children here too which is amazing I think! The movie is very well done and made perfect with the actors themselves. I guess a great choice for kids, a kids film. And I can never forget these kids who were all so awesome with this movie.<BEST FILM EVER!!!"
"I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do","I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do. I remember it very well in my time of watching it, being a little scared, it reminded me a lot of the movies of our grandfather's (and grandmother's in the movie), how difficult it is to work on a small budget, etc. The whole idea was to tell a family story. Every family member had their own story to their story, so they took to heart every one of them. These kids that played with the books, the family that had dreams and all of this was really a beautiful story of a child in transition, in love and in pain, who did what he wished, to all the kids who he knew at the end, how he overcame the obstacles, what was happening to them and how things really took his heart. This is a very powerful story and you would feel as happy as I did. (This is truly one film for all kids, kids and youth. My favorite movie is ""Killer Inside My Skin."") (T)"

You play as B,"You play as Burt Ward who's been married almost 50 years and whose wife has given birth to two children, but they've seen the life of John Cusack. He's more in love with Eddy than he's with himself yet to see anything in him; he also gets married twice and is divorced once.<br /><br />The story seems a bit silly at first but you realize soon what I'm saying and quickly become a very happy man. Bucky is even more generous to his victims (Ed, his girlfriend, a stranger, etc.), and he doesn't mind at all having sex with a stripper. I think it was pretty obvious to anybody watching the film, although I really don't care for the whole ""You've got to be kidding me"". I also liked the fact that Bumpy didn't do anything crazy, I wonder if it means he was more serious than his earlier role in the ""Burt"".<br/><strong>This movie should have been better seen in other movies that I haven't heard about as well.

This film caught me by surprise,"This film caught me by surprise and at the same time impressed me on a new and vastly different level.<br /><br />It took me awhile to come to grips with what I was witnessing, but that is part of the movie.<Br />I felt almost a connection with the characters and feel that the stories and characters created between the two leads are still interesting and the direction was different for a while after that. The film is an exploration of relationships between two characters which is a very good thing as I think many of us have found movies like HALLOWEEN and THE MOUNTAIN. I also enjoyed the story as well, which I believe was really meant as such but was very subtle and made me think there was more to it. A lot of people are reading up on this film and I wanted to share my experience, a lot I did not have to say was that great and quite honest as what this movie has to offer people. <br roundtable / blank, I won't comment further about this particular film, it is probably more of a prequel (like a LOT less), I would have preferred to have had it stay for at least a few years and have a second story or a character develop for me, the film was a good idea and a great way to"
I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival and I just wish I could pay my rent back. It was absolutely brilliant! I thought that it was a beautifully captured and visually stunning movie in many ways and with so few spoilers to let fans of history know of the time.<br /><br />But unfortunately, I had to miss that point of view a few months before I was picked up at a local cinema where I found it. I don't want to make ANY assumptions on the fact that the actors were great, the songs worked and the plot did not disappoint!<br/><BR />While I did like it a lot on its own, this is an excellent film. Although it takes itself more seriously than a ""War Zone"" adventure movie, in it it is also an engaging read/reel adventure film as the two main characters take a backseat to the big game plan which is a huge factor in deciding the final outcome. The story has a strong touch to it, and is quite well told! The music also works well, with an atmosphere that suits the characters, especially during the beginning of one of their encounters! For the young and inexperienced, it doesn't quite feel like a movie as of today, just a comedy of love that is not all it can be.<Br /></br"
THE JIST: See something else,"THE JIST: See something else with other characters that get killed, or put to a standstill when you think the story is going to wrap up!<br /><br />There's even a real reason for this one being used in the movie -- the characters are so young and they're basically like the older versions. There's a love triangle between characters who were all pretty good and characters from the old stories in this movie, like a child kidnaps a mother and kills the father. They were like two different characters: the oldest character is a young woman and an old adult character who both had parents. In this version they are basically the same as the versions in movies that don't have romantic or tragic stories, not a romance.<br/><span class=3=></br><BR />The rest of the action is just the usual action -- no fighting and no explosions. The kids aren't bad either, except in one moment when the main character grabs a gun and lets it fall, then she doesn't say anything because she knows the gun will fall. She makes just a loud laugh and runs back to her gun before shooting it again. Then what the hell is the point of carrying around a shotgun on a school playground? She has to stand behind a desk after shooting the shotgun!"
"Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank","Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank. We meet her at a bank that has a staff that have all sorts of problems and they don't know what happened. She says she met a lady on a date and she's having trouble sleeping with him for that night. He tells her he's not her type of guy and tells me, ""They did give him a girl but that'll show he was out of it for not being your type."" Alyssa Harris is the same girl too. A guy, he says, gets a hit on for trying to get rich and he gets away with it. Well at first she doesn't believe him and falls back on her ""role"" in the life of an alcoholic alcoholic. Then something crazy happens. There are big fights and a mob of angry people. What happens then is that two guys who are about to be raped by a drunk and that woman, Aileen's brother, walks into the bank yelling at us to hurry up and give her a blowjob. His brother says that he and her brother did the whole thing and the girl asks him, Do you remember that? A totally inappropriate scene. When A.J. gives birth, she has no choice but to go to the hospital for her baby. After a bit of her mother's breathing we're"
"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way. This is an entirely new film that was created to be a thriller thriller with a horror theme that is unlike any previous one. The story is like those movies that were made to bring suspense into movies. After that first film was released, the sequels became very popular. If you haven't already seen this movie, it's not really as scary as they came to make it out to. It's definitely the ""climax"" that has inspired me to watch this film more! For the plot and movie-making, there is a lot of mystery, violence, humor, and a great deal of fun to the viewer. There are some wonderful scenes in this flick, even if it is all from a different dimension. I also love the fact that we see some characters get along a little better than they should. One is really hard to describe (it's hard for me) and others just get off-kilter and disappear (like someone who would always do that would never be seen in other films, anyway). There is very funny moments and all the while you watch very well the whole movie. At the end of the movie there comes a moment in the first scene when it suddenly hits the spot you're looking for when you start talking over the phone. That is"
i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me,"i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me and he was as baffled by the plot as anyone (sorry to everyone who has watched my first film and the first half and still don't know it!).<br /><br />Overall I can't praise this one too much for being so well done but the storyline is very well executed by both the makers and a few great actors, including the lovely Charlotte Graham. There was enough to make you want to put that same ""one night stand"" theme to every movie you see and you would be totally hooked at how well they managed to capture the essence of each character's story. It is a shame I didn't see any of the films in my library back in 2006 for those of us who were quite excited to see that the genre has never really been more popular.<br -Possible, I haven't done this before but i have and i am delighted that they have done it and they did a very good job.<-Possibly."

This is what makes me proud to be British,"This is what makes me proud to be British and French. I don't have a problem with British accents. You would expect something from a British accent to come across as Italian - it is so cliché in both English and British history. As a result, much of what we are watching is of Italian origin, not British. It's refreshing to see people that are from the same part of America to learn something. This is the one movie that got me to know a lot about the American political system because it reminded me both of the United States and the European system of government. Also known as Great Expectations."
"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today. It is well crafted and very fun and the characters are all excellent. The story itself is very different to the earlier series and provides great insight for the viewers, they learn about the current times and how they can change the world to reflect them and do something that everyone else does in different ways.<br /><br />Although I have not seen all of the Coloper cartoons yet, I found many of them to be very entertaining. As much as I enjoyed the series it only reminded me of one I had seen in The X-Files years ago, but they definitely did not overwhelm it.< br />The other Colman cartoons were fine but the humor was only mediocre and I don't think that is all that was going on in this series.<Br /]However, the story was well-crafted and a good introduction to Colmauir. I think it is a funny television show to watch in it's current form - and that does have to include Colsanta-like humor. However much you watch it, in fact, you will find it funny and funny. Overall, Col-as-Fools-must-have-and-more-funny-but-not-dumb-this-series."
"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love and happiness and often thought of others as the true lovers of the people they are supposed to be serving. The idea of ""loving"" persons as strangers (who may be true or true as there may possibly be in all nations) seems highly improbable, and is no more than a pretense that the only way out of loneliness and lack of social support is for a person to join their society or to live like his or her parents to get their way in the world. This has now become the accepted notion, but is not even remotely plausible. It is all too real, it seems to me, even for adults. Even so, the main characters have become almost indistinguishable from their mothers or wives, which makes it hard for anyone to appreciate the difference. In fact, one character is so incredibly innocent that he/she completely assumes the role of a servant to any other human being (a role he and others at first despise), even ignoring his sister and mother (yet again), whose husband is clearly a jealous man with two wives (which is the real and truly shocking revelation on view). Even the movie's ""love story"" can hardly be described as anything other than the ""perfect"" love story: for it has been the first of many times it is portrayed in Hollywood,"
Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism in the film - and in its own way shows the dangers of seeing such bigotry on screen.<br /><br />Despite the criticism of Soderbergh who wrote this piece, I think the director was very generous in his comments in commenting on this movie and would take that criticism down if a person of his stature would like to see a bit more of it. This film is a beautiful film that shows, just as well as others, the problems and struggles of a small, and sometimes quite unique family, at its time.<div><span style=""mascara-mixed""; color=""#003030""; border-bottom, bordercolor=""#c0c90c""; text-shadow=#ffffff; padding:0; font-family:""Liberty"" style:""font-size:11px;""}."

(implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious","The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious I was laughing out loud at all the jokes. Oh dear for the love triangle the movie has (The guy gets beat up in her bed during her wedding ceremony), and the girls in the house just fall asleep in his office and she's just talking about how the cops are going to catch her but they will always find her and get her caught. The guy is a very beautiful looking guy and has big body and looks like a giant jester. There is also a real killer who is looking to kill the people that were working in that office, and it is really hard to imagine the character of the killer being a big, muscular joker. Meg and her roommate and brother are working at home, but when Meg says and talks about shooting her, they don't know where she is. That was funny as well. I love the whole idea of a killer trying to save people, however you can't help but be reminded of one movie that I wish I hadn't seen."
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films. Even with many flaws.<br /><br />So here's a story with so much symbolism (i.e. the ""twister's"" in the title, and how the monster in a coffin is identified) and some plot twists that are very interesting. There's no pretense there. The filmmakers do a great job showing us more than we are in real life (like in any science fiction flick), as well as showing that the actors themselves are not to be confused. Plus, there are many twists, even when they're not necessarily tied together. Another example is the fight scenes. From the very start, the story is set up like the normal side, with the monsters always having lots of firepower and the hero in danger. <br body count, however that's never really explained, because the heroes are always fighting monsters to protect the town from this evil entity, but just as the movie tries to portray reality on a much bigger scale, so as to make the audience think. And this is all one big twist. With several twists and turns in every movie, people's reactions don't change to just the horror scenes, as is true of most Sci-Fi movies (even classic films)! Also, it makes the film seem to me that a bad"
"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even","The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even if the plot line was well done.<br /><br />The rest of this film is just an incredibly bad excuse to bash the worst acting department ever released. The cinematography is horrible, the soundtrack sucks, and the movie has no direction whatsoever. It's also a boring, boring movie without even trying."
