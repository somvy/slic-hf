"By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's `Encounters of the Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic `A Better Tomorrow', `Zu Warriors' and the classic `Mr Vampire'","By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's `Encounters of the Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic `A Better Tomorrow', `Zu Warriors' and the classic `Mr Vampire' in 1984. Some other films such as 'Hollywood Blood', 'The Lost Cities of New York', ''The Big Sleep', and `Spirited Away in Hollywood' all have been'shopped down' because of their strong and positive reviews, particularly in Hong. However, it is here that Peter Chan (The Ghost Story) took the biggest lead in ""The Ghosts of Hong Kailu"" starring Sis Wuxi and Paul Verhoeven (Hair-raising Action). Wong and Wesser (Funko in `Carnage') played a couple who are in many ways the opposite of what they are supposed to be. The two are together but they don't have the same type of relationship. Peter takes the lead since he is trying to get away from the past, which is very hard to do in this day and age.<br /><br />We see the two characters being pursued by two different policemen who want their lives back from life. One officer is a criminal and fights back against the evil he has in him. If you want to see a Chinese movie for yourself, or even just a Western made by HongKong fans, then try this movie and its superb score. Its excellent and I highly recommend one of them"
"If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl","If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl! The storyline is told in flashbacks, so you can understand why her character is so different...but even then, that doesn't tell you much. The character's motivations are all vague at best, then the end abruptly leaves you confused by the very odd events leading up to it! If you ever wondered what a Grey- Owl died for, look no further! It really will make you ask the question ""Will we survive this next time we see her in a movie?"" If not, tell us...what about Peter Cushing's character?! It isn't as funny as it sounds - his only real redeeming quality is his portrayal of a ""baddy"", only this time he actually has a nice face! Why is Gray Owl called Edgar? Did Cushman (the father of John C. McGraw) never kill a baby? Or maybe Grey Owls are a kind of evil spirit that can touch and manipulate humans? In the beginning of ""Lost City"", when Edgar was young, the villain he wanted to use to kill someone was killed by a monster in the original movie by Gray, a very dumb man. Now, in ""True Detective"", Edgar is very intelligent - he's a psychopath, but he is more sympathetic than evil or evil...<br /"
"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards in the market. From here ""The Road"", as it is loosely structured, seems to be taking place in a real place. The film is set in Spain. In the town of Riquier, where its famous streets are located, in rural Spain I've found the film really has a kind of feel, and it's nice to see a lot of French cinema on their plates here. There is a sort of modern Spanish style style of cinema, that has been taken a long time to find a place here in Italy and even Italy has its own traditions when it comes to film.<br /><br />The main actors of both films are excellent. Rene Chandon has an excellent chemistry with Joan Cusack, he is brilliant as a young man, which is really nice. Joan Cuker's chemistry is also wonderful and she goes to the cinema more often than not every once in two years. Joan Chon has more charisma than any actor I would suspect, she has so much charm that everyone sees what she is up to and so it makes me feel a little more at home in her character. And as I said it almost seems like the whole picture is made up of a couple of very well-known French-versa-French actors."

"I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE","I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABEON.I hope there are others who do see this like me as well.It is very entertaining, and it takes the viewer inside the culture of the first world, or the black man/ghetto in the United States, to get a better understanding of it. The film is definitely not the same as those made in THE GOOD OR THE BAD. It is entertaining but still very raw, that makes it very difficult for me to sit through. I wish I could get past many of these and just watch it one more day, like all of BCAO, but for now I have a hard time."
"* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality ","* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality!!! Secondly, for the sake of being humorous it may not be the funniest series of some time (in my opinion this is in fact ""the funnest of these""),but I still think it remains the best of it. Finally, the only characters who stick out right are, of course, Kim and Kim Min Ho (the first, and first to ""have a good time""), Kwon and Choi, who are supposed to be just as funny and more adult, rather than serious.<br /><br />However, I cannot think of a worse series since K-Punk, even though it has a few flaws: and the main one is, without a doubt, a terrible one - but it's still *so** good. Not to say that this series must be avoided, but most likely, if you want to laugh at it, try the comedy, or at least try to catch it on cable."
This is a really fun movie,"This is a really fun movie as a story as well as the musical score which is one of the best ones I have seen in a very long time. My friends and I loved it all! It is an outstanding film! If you are looking for one or two bad films for Halloween-go-rounds, the movie will make you laugh but I won't spoil any parts of this film."
Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues,"Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues and is left with no option but to find herself in the position. Soon she does. As the world starts to get a little tighter there aren't any quick fixes. It isn't until several weeks later that he's back at work that a real change comes to his life.<br /><br />""A Man Seeking Freedom is the perfect story"", says Giannetti, ""because it is just as original."" From the first story it turns into something much much deeper. And indeed, I feel it has become a part of the mythology of France's cinema history. In two different years it will be even more influential. Paris is as much a place the people have lived, as a country where everything is taken for granted. At the same time, these people are not stupid or mean; They are just human beings, human relationships, that can easily turn against one another if needed. With ""A man seeking freedom"", they're free, and they can all return to their roles in society. They have a home and a life. ""I Love You"" is no exception."
"When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure","When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure, yet no one would give it a shot like it.<br /><br />The filmmakers wisely decided not to let this fad die.<Br />You're better off with something new, something original, and something to laugh at."
"Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions)","Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions) but still enjoyable. In addition to this, the film has more surprises, too. I found it hard-fought to accept the title ""Anna."" Some people may see this as a nod to one of John Ford's films, but at the same time, much of the plot focuses on a family who are struggling with alcoholism.<br //hinting at that is ""The Life and Times of Anna,"" and the story of a widowed father and his wife. While we get some very nice songs, some good action figures, and plenty of beautiful girls, I still never got past the end scenes. Despite having been released in English theaters, you still get something to like about the movie and enjoy the cast as well as their talent. The director seems to be putting a lot in to make the character appealing. <br/>< br />Some people on IMDb and elsewhere commented on the quality of this film. Others, like myself, have only read and are still very critical of it. Some believe it is a flawed, low-budget, slow-moving, german version. My own opinions are that this is not a bad film at all. But it can't be compared with American movies, with the exception of an Italian-American movie, or"
"Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls""","Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls"" in mock-fights during a festival where they sing and dance. ""We're gonna go on the show, do the dance,"" one drag queen tells him. The next day he receives a call in a newspaper that the girls are to be ""ratted."" An ""I'm the guy who's got what you've got,"" he says, to the dismay of his own daughter.<br /><br />Soon the queens start to show up. And to get to know them they have to deal with their own ""trick"" – to turn their back on one another and to see that each of them has something other than themselves. They are on-stage as singers and dancers and not only do they make it in their small-town world, they are all performers, often performing as performers on stage. There are a few good performers who appear frequently, and I like what I see, because the performers look much more like the people we see at the beginning during the live show. This is done very efficiently because they give different, meaningful musical performances. Every performer is different and they tell the same story, without leaving any room for improvisation. One of the producers's children, Michael (Richard Cavanagh), plays a role he didn't know for himself."

"If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie","If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie, only to find out the filmmakers were never the type who brought the movie to the screen and then turned it into a production company trying to make it a film they loved. This would not have worked. And if you like good horror movies, this film is probably the right piece of trash to put your head through. If you are a fan of bad movies you probably liked this one. I know some people disagree with me on this, but my comments do not express my opinion on anyone besides themselves."
"You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life","You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life and his wife. My sister-in-law thinks the episodes were too long, like most of these. She says, ""Hey, it's so long that the producers forgot who the writer is."" Huh? Well, the show could have started a little shorter if they let us think it had all occurred in the first two episodes, but maybe they could cut the lengths further, since some of the scenes are completely unnecessary for the story.<br /><br />Also, not even an expert could give me enough good reasons why this show had to go on such a long damn time. It was awful. Like when Clark gets killed, he doesn't actually have to be in his ""good old days"" again, and he is just sitting around in an armchair. I can't believe it. Even the good bits of that, when it comes out, were actually just not that funny. But, they are still entertaining, though only by the end, without a problem."
"After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth","After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth, however I did note that not all Chinese people do martial art. I believe that this is a matter of personal preference rather than of reality, hence the title of this movie. It is no more a movie of martial artists than a biography of their lives.<br /><br />This movie follows these two, in their first day of being ""educated"" by the ""great masters,"" the King of the Mountain, who teach their martial skills to all the young people from all China.<citation needed) The movie shows the people of China trying their best to earn that respect. Although, many of them are young, it is for this reason that they are not able to get a job at all. Their first job is to educate and educate the children and, unfortunately, they find it difficult, because they all have their own problems and many are forced to act more violent than usual as the main obstacle in the entire process. This is the greatest of all, as well as one of My favorite Chinese martial techniques, Shaolin. The way this sequence is written, and the way it's used is very impressive in many ways, such as when we are about to end the end, the man in charge makes the choice of turning away from the fight scene, or letting"

I've had my fair share of 'Honeymooners' before, especially if it was the likes of ""Happily Ever After"" or ""One Night In Paris"" but this one was a different story.<br/><BR />I do wish my favorite shows were more realistic but overall, it doesn't seem to be a masterpiece... and at times I wish the best of my time on this DVD."

"The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff","The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff of ""Bloodline"", but there are so many aspects to it which made it, I hope to never know the full story of, and why it is so horrible. In fact, the only good thing that this film has - the soundtrack - isn't quite as bad as it should be, but this shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />The problem with the film is that it doesn't offer anything in the way of character development. You don't see Michael Caine (his character) get to spend an hour with ""Dana"", and you don`t watch him develop into his girlfriend. This is a fairly easy character to follow, in his own way.<b />A good character is an actor with enough story to tell in just one episode of this trash. It`s hard to believe that ""Blues Brothers"" is something of a cult film at that point that was picked up by Hollywood. I think the best part of the movie is the part where he is trying desperately to keep some sense of purpose in dealing with his problems to his daughter, who is now his mistress and he has little support from her. The supporting role for Jason's character was made by a talented but immature actress named Molly Parker (Cuddy Smith as Mr. C"
"This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela","This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. It was published in 2006 at the same time that this film was being carried on the radio by a Venezuelan television station from Caravans. This documentary is a classic in this sense for it shows the story behind the events and in which it deals with its subjects.<br /><br />The subject of President Chavez's Venezuelan regime was not mentioned until about ten years ago and many of these reports from the US are quite factual regarding the regime. Such as the report of CIA Chief John Brennan and the information issued by the President's son that the American was in and out of government for many years.<Br /></br>< br />Unfortunately for the viewer who is looking for something more ""real"" than a typical documentary made to debunk that claim, or for those who want to know something that makes the topic seem as if the majority of what happened was a myth, this is not it. <br _br_"
This is a masterpiece footage in B/W 35mm film,"This is a masterpiece footage in B/W 35mm film photography, an extremely impressive combination that adds to the special effects, and is certainly worth spending a dollar on. There is so much going on in this movie that your mind cannot handle (at least not until you're dead at the end). This is not a film about a boy from the world's poorest village who works for a bank. A film that will leave you asking yourself ""how could this be?"". This film really doesn't have all that much (of a story though) and it deserves a 10 as a bonus. Great production design, great cinematography and great performances. Don't miss this, this is one of the best, underrated B-W film films out there, you deserve it!"
This is one of the best Bollywood movies i have seen up until now,"This is one of the best Bollywood movies i have seen up until now, one for me that was more about people and characters than money and sex. i also liked the scene where the actors' costumes were made of white plastic, while the movie was about the reality of bollywood in general, where people make costumes.<br /><br />As the film progressed I started to get more interested in the women, especially the one. After watching the first couple of times i felt more and more like a fan, i think most of these women are not ready for sex, or even men, so i started watching them.<b/c>Well the thing that impressed me the most was how they kept telling the story in a simple or very simple manner, they told it simple by way of how it was going to be filmed (the ending). The rest of it came down to how these people had been watching it, and then when it started it felt even more complicated. The final part i loved all the way was that they got this story out even when the ending seemed to only be a few minutes long. I mean, it seemed like hours, maybe minutes, but hey, that's the kind of story that we like to follow. In all honesty this is so much more fun than waiting for the action to occur, which is actually"
"This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments","This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments, one can be easily fooled by the music or some of its images. However, the real beauty of this episode is shown in the final few minutes by Ben. He's not a dull hero, but rather a ruthless and wise cop. Ben's character doesn't like to talk to the other characters about anything and seems to just be a regular ""good guy."" It works well and makes sense, especially when you realize that Ben was a very popular police officer before he was finally given the nickname. All in all, this is a truly fine episode that is just about the most disturbing time I have ever been in."
Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen in the 'eighties. The first was A Daring Tale of Two Sisters, the second was Cinderella's Curse, and the third was one of those fairy tale stories that was really good. And there are a couple of things I think Disney should've said earlier on on, but here's a tip, if you have seen any of them before, or have anything to do with this one, you should do it. As one reviewer has said, this has the most famous scene ever involving a little girl and a prince. If you've seen The Legend of Ice and Fire, go for it, too. I could write anything out of this movie. <br /><br />In other words, it's the ultimate story line you can see in your cinema. But if there is one movie that has all the things it promises, well...it's The Adventures of A Prince and Princess.<br/><brief spoiler]<branch><o<b)the first of 3 princes in Disney's film.

I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it,"I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it. This is a truly rare, original book and I am proud to say that it is the only one of its kind that i did not have to learn. I mean that with respect to the other two movies they play in this case because they are all about Hamlets (at least I think I understand what is meant by that word); and they have their moments of surprise at times, and the time between them is not that different from any of the times the characters are at the end of their stay in England.<br /><br />I think the acting is really good, the script is still quite fresh, but the songs and dialog are still great and well written."
"When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987)","When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987) or ""Nightfall"" (1993). I'm not giving it low marks because I am disappointed, however, because of the film's tone. This is no vampire flick. Its a horror flick and the script is like a ""scary movie at it's best."" No budget or technical details, no scares, nothing. The acting is mostly a joke and not worth spending several hours on. It's not scary, though; it feels that way. I have no problem with vampires being scary and that's good. But when you really feel that you'll miss something worthwhile in this type of film--after the last two years. And this was not that fun. One of her most memorable moments...and the moment of absolute terror I could not believe was the sequence about four other people walking up to a tree that is next to her house. There is nothing new and interesting in watching these people do things they would normally have done or not have the time to, or learn and do a thing that others would in order to stay alive. No surprise there, that she was able to do what she did so well. <br /><br />The ending is good, but the acting for this director is really weak. Most vampires can make great vampire actors, and most"
"I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban","I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban. It had several very clever dialogues and was well-presented. What they had it for, though, is that I found the movie boring. You feel like they are just watching old movies and not actually caring for one another. Also, one of the other reviewers said that it seemed a lot of characters died. That seems very odd. In theory this sounds a bit like a parody.<br /><br />As for the plot, well, I can see it being very interesting if it's supposed to be a satire. But as a criticism, it just has no effect whatsoever. I didn't really mind it at all. <br *1/2"

The snake-man leaves the package for him without telling everyone and, as a precaution, decides not to take it. In the meantime, Richard realizes he has a secret.

I've seen far better films like this before. As someone who's watching more of them this is simply awful.<bs/><bs />This is a waste of time. The acting, editing, plot etc. are all totally terrible and stupid. And the fact that their producers did not want you to think they were giving you the answer to any of these questions, is utterly awful. All you have to do is watch the ""real"" movie if you're looking for any good. To make you think it has the same ending, just leave the TV. Just leave your parents to deal with their child's problems - not even watch a video of one of the dumbest, ignorant children watching a movie as that.</bs]"
To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made,"To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made in the world. The cinematography is stunning and perfectly capturing the stunning cinematically breathtaking world of a modern time of luxury and the constant travel of the American way of life. A matter of human beings and other machines are in decline right now with more and more people coming to us to live on our planet of our birth. There is no doubt this movie is the most powerful and exciting work I have ever seen and I loved the fact that it is now on a lot of screens throughout the entire world which means the people everywhere and it becomes amazing when the great actors and director of this film, Jules Verne, have come forward to do another amazing job with his films. It is an honor and tribute to all the wonderful work this man has done and he deserves it. Great film and one for all those that are passionate about art and science and so that's all that I ask you on the whole mankind to come work, not only for this but to spread the word all in all parts of humanity and to make it known to others. You can make this great film for a great time and you can also make a film that people will love for generations to follow for any lifetime if you wish.<br /><br />Thanks to anyone, any and all who have"

This is a brilliant political satire,"This is a brilliant political satire at one point (and this is not only from a real political perspective) and yet comes right back to it. In the scene where Michael is at his office after his release, he gets dressed in the red robe of the President of Indonesia and invites them to his home, which was a pretty lavish home built for him in a very expensive villa. When he is asked how he should live in this village, his answer is like ""it ain't your country, it's mine"". This is where the film just hits the fan and has a great ending. Even this movie has its problems. There wasn't much tension during the movie, but if you look closely you can see that there was at least some tension. The last scene, where they are drinking in water with the kids, is pretty funny; it helps the laugh-fest even further. I believe this film would benefit the entire country if the U.S. stopped using military bases in Africa, for instance, and just stopped the practice and replaced it with something more dignified and dignifying. This movie goes very well with his story as well; there are many great scenes in it, like for example when he tells Michael how bad his wife found out that her husband was on the way home from"
You play as B,"You play as Burt Reynolds, the wily, but not to be confused with ""the kid with the big, brown face""). He is a good guy and makes bad choices. He has an interesting voice, particularly in this one, and is quite charming--the actors here really get a glimpse of him in his prime and are very funny, too. Robert Wagner is no match for this bad little role. But he is well-meaning. The film starts out promisingly, when Reynolds and Bresson discuss their childhood experiences, which end up being both predictable and downright disgusting. Reynolds is about six and has been growing increasingly nervous about everything, no matter how well the story develops. They also share one other wonderful memory--one that is told directly by him afterward--and it is fascinating that they are actually together. Although the dialogue is different they share a very simple way of talking, making it almost an adventure between them. I also liked the way that the actors are really funny in their characterizations, especially their portrayal of themselves. It is difficult to say whether they had a great deal of the humor and humor in a serious role, or just some of it. That's about all I think. Another thing that impressed me deeply was the fact that there are an astounding number of"
This film caught me by surprise,"This film caught me by surprise as an Australian actress so I went into the film thinking it would be a true comedy. It was so true.<br /><br />I was really floored by how it became this funny. This movie gives you an opportunity to do good acting in a completely different form in terms of acting. Not as a performance but as comedy, as being able to relate to the viewer. There wasn't a single bit of nudity or anything else.<BR />My only complaint is that the direction and costumes. Every single scene and sequence was beautifully done, the art direction is excellent and looks stunning. The lighting and the acting was great. I highly recommend the movie to anyone who is able and willing to pay money for it. A must see. Recommended for anyone in the arts, drama, or comedy-making."
I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. The story is so simple, it's downright fascinating--something very little has been forgotten. I will not give away more information, but suffice it to say the film is very engaging and very entertaining. If you haven't seen the movie yet, check it out."

"Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank","Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank account. We meet her when a friend goes out to dinner with her and she tells you that she has fallen in love with the banker and all he told her is, ""it was bad."" The friend tells her to go ahead and tell her what happened with his girlfriend. So what did her friend tell him? She said: ""Why not?"" This sounds nice as is with a lot of films nowadays, but it is so much more in the hands of director of this classic film such as Jürgen Habermas and Jurgen Van Den Broeck. The problem is this is a story about an American couple who go to Australia to find and take care of their dying parents.<br /><br />The film begins with an extremely boring film. You watch a man with curly hair and a blue-eyed face, and his character comes to life through several flashbacks which look like they were put on the floor in a bathtub. Then, a series of flashbacks come. Now, look at it for a second: here is the whole thing. Why is he talking about the death of his own mother? What a mess he is talking with. There is an awful scene as his wife is sitting just about to be raped by a stranger, in which a"
"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way (it is also written in this way by a similar writer). The story is set in the early years of the 50's in New York City and the action scenes are set right in time and set just after the assassination plot of Lee Harvey Oswald. The audience gets very frightened as Oswald goes off to work for the CIA and is gunned down. A film so perfect in its execution (and director and star) that there are no surprises but an intense suspense, a gripping atmosphere and a haunting conclusion."
i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me,"i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me thought it was hilarious at first. As you know the show started making the rounds in the US and was picked up by TV channels and in Canada like many others. And what was it about? What the fuss was? Well the movie is set in a small town and does have a good character. There are a few different characters and many different problems to solve which is why this film has to be funny. The humor is interesting to watch and the humour is good enough and this makes it worthwhile to have such a movie. I would say that ""B"" is better than ""L"" and for the people who haven't seen the original."
"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect","The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect and i just think this movie has the potential to entertain your curiosity.<br /><br />For me, I found this film a fun to watch, well made, funny and interesting, with lots of laughs and heart breaking moments. The writers also managed to pull together many of the elements of The Sopranos which made 'The Sopanos' funny to me. I do think that the writers tried to keep it simple and thought about what they could accomplish, even if it would not be something quite like the 'Viper and Dixon' but the final decision seems like it was made based on a lot of inspiration from their past. Another thing this made it enjoyable to see is how The Wire's characters, and their motivations were intertwined. They're not just their own, they're almost more like relatives who love each other, because a family that falls in love with one another is something that really happens that makes up the entire family.<Br />I give this 10/10 and hope for a better sequel to 'A Christmas Carol'. My vote is 100.<BR /]"

"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love or of people who have made so many beautiful faces! For those that love fairy tales, they will find that they have found that a new appreciation of the magic of love is not so essential to their understanding of such wonderful stories as this! We must also remember that romantic love, and most of its aspects, have a timeless value. The most beautiful woman, in the history of human beings has shown her talents in all fields to the exclusion of men; the greatest great warrior has made a magnificent contribution for all mankind but it is now lost into the great and mysterious battle which must not be won! I am therefore very grateful that The Lady is alive and I hope to see her again! <br /><br />What a very great movie I have seen since I started, this is a beautiful movie that has a wonderful romantic story that shows us how love can truly be the very tool we use to make love. All of us have experienced what love means. So it feels great to me that the two famous actress, who plays Queen Anna, is very special in portraying this beautiful picture! You will also get to tell that these two great actors have wonderful faces as well as lovely beauty! And, the music played by Michael B. Jordan is the best of both worlds -"
Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism in the wake of the New York Stock Exchange disaster and the subsequent rise of fascism in Europe. By the time he finished his documentary, it had been a decade since he had seen it. In fact, no one knew what to expect from this film, and even the first two years were very disappointing. I felt like I had just had a good laugh. And, in case you hadn't noticed yet by now, there is a long segment that depicts Adolf Hitler, as the ""master of all"" and Hitler was able to win the war by using Hitler as pawn! In conclusion, this is not a film to be missed."
"The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious","The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious because Meg's ""fascination"", as a matter of fact, was more about playing the male mechanic's male assistant than the female mechanical's. The character of Meg and the mechanical were exactly the same-looking, for one thing-and, this is true, it could also be assumed that the character in question of the robot being the first to die from a falling arm was a female robot-as in, the third person was the only one who got a second chance. Also, I love a scene where the three robots are fighting the dead man's wife or whatever so I guess you can say anything I want. There are actually two different versions and you also have to remember that on a different day when the robots were the victims, they were killed by a flying arm as opposed to falling flat on their faces(not a funny thing at all)and the ""dies"" at that point were also the body parts of a robot that had been stabbed and had a couple of other pieces, even for a male, that were severed in parts for reasons unknown. I thought ""That must be very funny"" and ""She's a human so let's throw some food at her"". So the best bits were really funny... the ones that made sense from the get-"

Anyway, I was going to see this movie and watched it all the way through. I had a pretty hard time coming up with a reason to like this film at all.<br /><br />Of course, the entire plot hinges on what happens to one character who is a very odd guy and what he does to make everyone happy.<BR / R / G / E / T / A / L / D / H <br body count=35> So for example, we have a lot of oddball characters with very little time to work out what is happening to them.
