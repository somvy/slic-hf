"By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's `Encounters of the Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic `A Better Tomorrow', `Zu Warriors' and the classic `Mr Vampire'","By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung's `Encounters of the Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic `A Better Tomorrow', `Zu Warriors' and the classic `Mr Vampire' -- but Hongkongers still didn't know the genre or the medium was just a series of scary film clichés, a few obscure lines, and a bunch of cheap tricks to fool us into thinking that there is a movie to be made.<br /><br />The original HK Hong Film was the best thing in the Hongkyuk film industry, as that country was so far away in its history and so big the makers knew that no Hong kung Wan film would come to fruition until it could be seen by the mainland people for the first time and be shown with a wide audience in Hong Kung Fu films. Since then they have developed so many of these films since then with 'The Master of Kung', with almost 200 million copies being sold -- and with `Ran Gung Gang' in 2002, just the kind of films Hong Hongked Kong was known for from the start.<b />The main plot is not completely good in that it is made mostly by one of Wan Wei's older brothers, who is also the director of Hong-kung's great silent film `Xin Hong Zhi' (Sung Fu, 1987). However there are elements of HK movies that are enjoyable and not very entertaining -- for example the fact that we don't"

"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards from the bottom. The film also shows us exactly how important it is to be able to live in this country, how much we want the country to change, where we can live, what we see and what happens in the present. But all of these things are not enough for Louis Renaud, who comes from France, as well as from other regions, to make this film. He did indeed create a film, ""The Life and Death of Jean Enelieux,"" but not a masterpiece. Like its predecessor, this is just another example of a ""periodical"" film being made. Unfortunately for him too, he has already decided to leave the company to become ""a writer"" (Jean Enfant), so he's never seen a perfect work."
Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made,"Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made - in fact, it has made this movie the best film I have ever seen in my career. There are quite funny scenes throughout this film. The songs were by a great number of great singers such as John Waters, Tom Waits, David Bowie, George Bush and John Glenn. We also love the music of James Dean as he sings in all three of his songs. One of my very favorite scenes - the scene where he uses the old tape recorder to record the film's music was one I had never heard before. A lovely piece of filmmaking - but most of all - a film that I think should never be seen again! <br /><br />This is an incredible movie that would be a major classic! My wife and I took part in the screening and were so blown away that we bought tickets for it! I thought that was a GREAT movie! This is the perfect movie to hang out with friends and family, as well as to spend time with loved ones. After seeing it many friends have commented to me that it is my favorite performance in any of their films. Everyone has a story. This movie is just one film of people being in love with their great selves. In fact it seems to be written by everyone! If you are one, you should"
"I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE","I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABEUS. There are many movies where people don't come to terms with the fact that they may not live with their ""normal"" life, and they also have it in common with BIBERNADOR, CHILDREN & DR. EYVEN. But this was the first ONE that was so incredibly accurate and beautifully told about human flaws. It made me so aware of the flaws in everyone else. <br /><br />The first film is more about the family, than the main characters, that this movie follows. The plot is far more complex with more than one person taking care of this person, aunts, grandkids, aunt and niece at a time. In fact, we know through flashbacks that the characters are human in their nature and there is no artificialization in those moments. We are not given personal stories, relationships. Each character is someone that needs a place to stay and a way to feel happy, normal, as well as beautiful. This can really be a part of who and what the character wants.<br/>< br />If I had to choose a film of my life in which I loved the story, then this one would be BAZING!<br - <big thanks to everyone involved for watching this!!!! :)"

"When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure","When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure and one of the worst films of it all, and it deserved to be condemned...a fine film, if you are into the horrors of cinema.<br /><br />This film was filmed at the turn of one century and a third of a century after the publication of Dostoyevsky's ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", and from then on it has become a major hit in film making circles worldwide and has sold, both as a new and timeless masterpiece and in popular film and television.<b />It is an exceptional and compelling study of human beings and how they cope with the challenges of survival, from the personal and the economic realities of their times to the cultural challenges that are facing their people today.The film is made up of fascinating characters in various roles who are both courageous enough to face the problems today and naive enough not to over think this issue.<citation needed).<br _SPOILER_ <br><btw, I've got to admit that when I saw the trailer, which shows the film now on DVD - the first twenty minutes is quite entertaining to watch and although the acting here isn't great, it does have it's moments.

"Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions)","Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions) in comparison. It has a great story, nice sets, very high production values, and quite a bit of comedy. And a special soundtrack by Michael B. Jordan and Jeff Bridges - the latter of which may seem to be a nod to the other two directors too - that works especially well with the film that begins with Anna. A film with two very different actors and with lots of different things happening throughout the whole film - Anna is a fine role, she can be wonderful and sympathetic (if not a little silly) and I have seen much newer directors work on this type of film in their later films and this certainly adds some new surprises for them. The plot begins in a small town with an orphaned man who's moved to America (Emanuel) for a very very young age. He then is killed by a gang of gangsters. That makes him fall into a coma, but soon he gets back in touch with his real love. In an attempt to get back the orphan boy, it turns out when everyone is around he is murdered by some insane old man. This brings the family to Sweden, where Anna, who is very innocent of his death, goes to an old witch house. She has an evil spirit and wants him dead.<br/><BR />"

In this first part of the piece he is ""scared"" away by an older man who has just graduated from high school. His mother takes him to see her uncle, who is playing with his dog during the day. He is in love with her and her mother believes him, as does a girl named Leland. The young boy, played by actor John Doe, meets these drag queen girls. But after some trouble, they break up and become separated. Lyle goes to New York to find his uncle. A few days later the drag lovers share a car. They are both killed and Lela's body is discovered. After a few hours, Lel's mother has a daughter named Anna. She finds an old body in the woods in Long Island. And while Anna's father, a lawyer, is at a funeral, her father is killed by a motorist. Anna turns to the law, and says: ""I'll be back here now. I promise I will show you another murder you've never heard of. As for my next murder? The same law I'll keep you safe now.""

I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals,"I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals, but it might be a decent effort.<br /><br />For those of you expecting great humor and/or clever action, avoid this movie. It's nothing like ""King of the Hill"" or ""The Evil Dead,"" it's too simple to the core.

"If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie","If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie of its type. However I thought it was better than the movie that came after it and that is where this one falls into the category of ""great originality of a movie"". I was completely disappointed.<br /><br />I guess the reason why this is among my favorites in the book was I found it to be excellent. I think I'm talking all the little things. So what are they? I like ""American Pie,"" so when I heard ""Scooby Doo,"" I laughed my ass off.<-SPOILER AHEAD!<br p.s. If you are confused by the title, its Italian and should not be confused. And its not even really an American Pie at all, although you see me and I did come across a few other American classics, most notably ""Peep Show,"" which I didn't see.<p.t. the story of what is, what was, and what isn in this film just goes on and on.<Br />At the end, I want you to watch ""Amigo Amigo!"" For me, the best parts of this are my comments on this great movie"
"You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life","You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life and how he finally comes to terms with his feelings. In particular, the episode begins with Lois and Clark trying to explain each other to each others in their quest to find the missing boy. The whole point of the show, as explained in the movie, was that ""the child was not lost, but was just gone"". Now, there is quite an amount of suspense in everything we do in this finale. There are so many twists and turns at the end that it seemed like there was no end to everything, so no explanation (which would have been impossible). So, for example, Lois is upset on hearing her father was killed by what looked like a rocket. Of course, ""he knew his grandfather"". Even so, it was clear that the two men had a long history to go through. So we are not only rooting for Lois, we also root for Clark. Unfortunately, here, this is a huge spoiler, and will get you completely bored with the entire movie.<br /><br />Finally, to tell you the truth, I really hated the ending. For the good of all the family, Clark had to come back to his old life, only to realize something that had completely changed him and his life. He became an adult and realized what a burden"

I'm glad because I loved it and was able to sit through almost all of it!! It's funny and makes you laugh so much!!! My family loved the show! The Simpsons are such a great sitcom and I thought that I'd also like to get this show back on TV so that they can grow their fan base and become even more fan of me because a lot of times I watch them on television and they have been my family!

i loved this movie,i loved this movie and as his favorite character the movie was a must see. He also had no need to read a book and never got bored reading it. I think the movies were entertaining and if i could see this in my head the next day it would. i give This movie a 7 for the sheer entertainment and i was amazed at just how easy it was fun for me and my kids. The movie is a MUST SEE for all ages and for a family who loves to watch the adventures of Jack Frost and Jack Bauer.

"This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela","This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. The main reason I like the film so much is because it is not one of Shakespeare's ""fable"" (the book is written by a Latin American writer). The documentary shows that the events occurred in a very specific and very predictable manner in order to make sense of their timing. I recommend you take the time to see the documentary on a high level. It is a must see as you are going to be watching history unfold while also feeling the same kind of feelings of loss and grief you felt when watching Romeo and Juliet with friends. Watching this documentary is an important experience because the emotions of Romeo (and Juliet) and the feelings you were feeling when visiting your grandparents and parents are what makes this film unique."
This is a masterpiece footage in B/W 35mm film,"This is a masterpiece footage in B/W 35mm filmography with outstanding story line, actors, special effects, and editing that will leave you breathless for days. The cinematography, especially in regard to the subject matter, is captivating and one of the reasons I've rated this film 8/10. In fact, with its superb cinematographic background of B&W film making and with the film's stunning cinemas all over Texas, this movie may as well not even exist in America! This film offers no of that either!"

Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen for the first time. The movies were all the same from beginning to end, yet all of them in a way that made the films look as if they were made at their own time in 1953. For instance, the movie begins with the beautiful princess of Cinder who plays a prince who is a little older than her at first but she eventually goes on to marry him and she is sent to live with him for a couple of years in an island called Bitter Water. On his visit she meets the prince of his mother, but as she was married to a man, she would not allow him to come to her house much longer. All the while, her father, a handsome knight, makes a series of incursions on the island with his army. It is his intention to have his beloved princess marry her brother of her own choosing, not her sister. Then what will happen to Cinders and the princess? With his arrival in Batter Water, he meets a young man named Grendel, an aristocrat known as the ""King's Servant"". His presence is so enchanting, you can almost feel Gendel's excitement in seeing that he is there at all. Along a journey to Bher Water the young prince ends up killing his uncle and father"
I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it,"I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it, the musical score and of course the actors. I loved how well the characters were made and how they did it through the narrative.<br /><br />The whole movie's is pretty simple. The characters are mostly good, but if you get enough time to keep watching they'll be fine. This movie is not for everyone, whether you have read the book, or you just saw it. If you do have, be aware it might be a little long and you may have to watch some more of Shakespeare. There is also a lot of nudity for good measure, and the whole film is really pretty graphic. It's funny as hell and really very long, it was good for me. To me that's enough background on the story to make it worthwhile for people."
"When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987)","When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987) but instead I got the ""Vampirism"" (1997) instead. I love vampires (and, for good measure, the acting in this case) and these are what I enjoyed most about this movie. Director/star Rhett Reese has a good reputation to his credit for capturing some of the '80's horror and action sensibilities (not all of them are great) by having the ability to depict a very dark scenario in such a short time. In fact one of my favorites scenes from this ""movie"" is when the main female zombie (as you'd expect) takes over the camp and she is the one responsible for an entire plot line. She ends up being the director when she murders a male vampire(who is basically a female vampire who never really got in touch with the characters) in one scene. Overall I was shocked to find out that ""A Vampyrism in California"" was made prior to this, to the shock I did. The fact that Reese made this out to look like this should have gotten over your nerves a lot, since this just seems like a ridiculous ripoffs of Dracula's Dracula in a silly light. Not a surprise! A perfect example of a film like ""a vampire flick in 1980"" which takes liberties with some key"
"I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban","I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban, but after seeing it as a young man, I don't feel any pity for the poor black youth trying to make the most of it: It made me laugh. I was very proud of that moment... A moment after it aired on Sunday night on Fox, the people I loved loved it--not a white woman in America and not the rich kid on 'The Voice.'<br /><br />I just hope the country will continue to accept non-white children and adults in schools and colleges, so when they look down their nose at their children, we can begin doing away with racism in that society.<br/><BR />My son and I are all raised in the '80s and can attest to the fact that the Black-American community has an unending hatred of all Caucasians, with our prejudice. We would much love to see us be a part of a great generation of artists! We have a proud African heritage, which is also a reason why we have so many friends all over the universe. The White-White-I-Am distinction would go a long way towards creating a culture where kids will be able to express and grow up who are totally different and true to themselves. Unfortunately the story is so complex that we cannot understand what happened"

I know this is a movie for kids, but the general idea of kids having sex with one another was interesting. It was funny, the kids were in there too for so long and this was like something one would see in a family movie or something, It could have been anything...I liked the other characters in this script were the best I have seen in my life...not one of those cliché kids who is scared or stupid...if you are going with the story, you must have read it! I could give it a 1 not very recommend...the acting is just great. The movie never went off the rails as the script or actors were great and my kids really enjoyed it..."

To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made,"To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made for that particular genre. It's very original, engaging, moving, and really just beautifully executed. You get to find out the truth about how a young person is able to live a life just like that of John Waters - a film that will give you a vivid insight into the people who made that film (and in my opinion that is one of the most memorable performances in modern cinema). A Life of Love is a very very emotional movie, with moments of sadness, joy, anger, fear and triumph. John Carpenter also directed some memorable films such as Death In A Bucket, which is about a great many people, this film also had John's real personal struggle. And finally... a brilliant film. Definitely worth watching."

"I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do","I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do. I remember it very well in my time of watching it, being a little scared, it reminded me a lot of the movies of our grandfather's (and grandmother's in the movie), as we were never really able to see his character or their situations, much less understand the story that was portrayed. As a very sensitive adult this is one movie I would recommend to anyone who wants to understand those who are unsure of certain stories, the role of God, etc. This is a great little mystery movie that tells of a mysterious mystery in our society, as well as the way we live, live and think about God in a small way, this one should make all of us in awe, wonder and be a huge impact, if not, we could all be in God's mind for this moment in time as it's important that this experience is explained. <br /><br />"

You play as B,"You play as Burt Ward who's been married almost 50 years and whose wife has given birth to two children, but they've seen the life of John Cusack. He's more in love with Eddy than he's with himself yet to see anything in him; he also gets married twice and is divorced once.<br /><br />The story seems a bit silly at times but the acting is superb and the characters are really strong. A bit of comedy in this flick as Ward and Ward keep making the same connection with each other but sometimes even more because they're in the story at first. Definitely not a classic but a great movie to watch.<b/><ul><ig: 9 stars out of 10."

She says she met a lady on a date and left, having gotten pregnant with a child that was the result.<br /><br />I've seen some films with this type of type who are not as good as this and I think it's a terrible movie: not good enough to entertain an American audience."
"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way. This is an entirely new film that was not only more successful in my opinion but also more original, unlike all previous films. The story is very intriguing and the dialogue and acting is wonderful. It's definitely one of King in the cinema as an old-timer rather than a younger one because I believe he will have a big influence on the film's fate to his later years. I highly recommend this because the movie's not just a simple murder thriller but it has everything a killer can ask from a movie-going public to an older one by all accounts. Although I only know a couple of the director and actors, the story isn't a thriller or even a story about a young man and a family. You go with the flow and not with a lot of tension or plot twists...you know something is going to happen in this film and you know how the events will end.<br /><br />This is a very new and original film...even today its still worth watching if you are a fan!"
i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me,"i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me and he was as baffled by the plot as anyone (sorry to everyone who's watched my first film and the first one and still hated it). The acting was fine and good, the sets and costumes all were in the best location for this kind of production (just go to movies like this). I highly recommend you watch it and see it."

This is what makes me proud to be British,This is what makes me proud to be British and French. I don't have a problem with British accents. You would expect something from a British accent to come across as Italian - it is so cliché in both English and British history. But it makes the film one of the best ever made. It deserves to get the chance it deserves.
"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today. It is well crafted and very fun and the characters are all excellent. The story itself is very different to the earlier series and provides great insight for the viewers, they learn about the current times and how they can change the world to work effectively and do something that everyone wants.<br /><br />Mimi Ota is great in all three films as her father and her husband. She is a very sensitive person. Her heart is much more open, her emotions are so open and true, in every scene. Some believe that by being together, she gives all that she does to others, for us. We can laugh at her mistakes, but the truth is, everyone works their way to happiness.<BR />This movie is probably one of my favorites because of some wonderful dialog, some memorable scenes that have a certain emotional depth, it is just that much fun!<br/><strong>8/10"
"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love and happiness and often thought of others as the true victims of it.<br /><br />This film is not only an exercise in characterization of the plight of human love against the overwhelming backdrop of reality; there is a very real and highly emotional connection found between the stories of both the children and the adults that exists in the minds of adults who have the misfortune to view these stories on a purely fictional basis like children. And there are stories that people in their daily lives tend to believe they have found that love is both powerful and profound and human in all its ways, for it is something that the child is forced to think and experience because of his own selfish feelings of rejection and contempt or his personal sense of inferiority, ignorance or inadequacy. The emotional weight of these emotions are enormous and very powerful indeed. There is so much in this film that I was in awe of and admired as much as any child or adult that ever sat in front of me. As well as being extremely touching to witness, the film also captures the emotional impact of love, love as everything that each individual is feeling. By using this story and its relationships so closely linked to each of our main characters and with the story's relationships, we begin to discover how different individuals can act in everyday life"
Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism in the film - and in its own way. The result is not of the script - but a mixture of all those elements which have become familiar throughout the years.
"The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious","The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious I was laughing out loud at all the jokes. Oh, for the love of the movie, does that make the cast all of three, I guess.<br /><br />So there you have it... I think that this was an absolute disaster in every way and I'm sure I will never write another review about it and get any of this right... but I can tell you that even worse... The fact that the producers wasted one more year filming this movie and decided to have a script that was so unbelievably cliché and ridiculous that it's hard to believe their decision to spend it directing (and even considering how much money, time and resources they had dedicated to this production) means that by just having this crap shot off and shot from start to finish they couldn't have even succeeded in getting an audience interested. Just plain stupid."
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films. Even with many flaws.<br /><br />So here's a story with so much symbolism (i.e. the ""twister's"" in the title, and how the monster in a coffin is identified) and some plot twists that are very interesting. There's no pretense there. The filmmakers do a great job showing us more than we are in real life (like in ""House on Haunted Hill""), as shown by the creepy old man's hand to hand combat. Plus, one of the characters, called Jarl Krasinski, makes a delightful supporting cameo appearance as the old monster. This is one movie that will be the first to use this, for as long as I can remember."
"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even","The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even if the plot line was well done.<br /><br />The rest of this film is just an incredibly bad excuse to bash the worst acting department ever released. The cinematography is horrible, the soundtrack sucks, and the movie has no direction whatsoever. It's also a boring, boring movie without even trying."
