And it had also given me The Muppet Movie, the cult favourite film of 1987. But as the film progressed it became increasingly difficult to stay awake!"
"If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl","If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl. The plot involves the ghost of a man who was the man behind the Grey- Owl murders of the people living near The Big House in the early 90's. Now this is probably the biggest movie I've seen in years, the fact that the characters are beautiful makes it really one to watch! Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves to tell their stories of all sorts, it's a very original, powerful, intelligent, funny movie, absolutely incredible! I particularly found myself crying when I saw this film, having it be called ""Annie Galileau"" in my name! It's definitely made me laugh. As soon I heard that there was a sequel, my jaw dropped!<br /><br />Overall, this was brilliant! Great movie. It is definitely a must-see for all of us who enjoy classic horror movies/suspense films and if you're into some great horror films, Grey owls are for you! This movie is absolutely terrifying, very atmospheric and very well-done for the money. I recommend it for anyone that loves Gothic Horror, Spaghetti Westerns, The Secret of Sleep, Gothic Thriller, B&W horror, thriller, horror/thriller/horror/sci-fi, sci"
"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards from the pearly gates of capitalism, so much so that to this day, we've lived outside of our homes, our shops and our supermarkets in our country, far from our shores. The film tells the story through a film-making that was filmed with film, film making, photography and film. This is an entirely original film and, despite what many see as an over-reaction of ""The Deer Hunter"", it is a brilliant film to behold. Peter Sellers' film has the opportunity to show our world through our young minds and to provide the audiences with an opportunity for genuine insight into human behaviour, how it affects our everyday lives, and how some people think about it. That is the kind of film you film from. It is not simply about ""the good people who live behind fences"" or some small group of aristocratic people living above their means who try to rise above a corrupt political system and make their living off of it, but about the people from whom we are born, growing up and changing over time. Sellors gives us a glimpse into what's going on in the contemporary world, showing how things are all going in a way that does not always translate to your own country. One of Sellars' best scenes is his interview with one"
Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made,"Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. There is a lot going on to be interesting in this movie. For an average person, or for a horror movie buff such as me myself. The story is about this young boy who has left his mother's house with him to find a better life, and now he wants to join the army, at age 25. He then meets the soldier at the train station where he meets his fiance. Then he goes to see a local man he met on news that soldiers have begun attacking his country who then starts fighting them. This movie works very well in bringing this film into film culture's eyes, by offering us a very realistic look at life in war with a true story. Also great is the supporting cast, all strong as well as the one-man band the music is from (Piper(of 'The Beatles', who plays the villain of 'Fatal Attraction' in the movie), by the way is in excellent taste. Excellent movie, very interesting plot, good story that is funny fun for everyone. Wonderful atmosphere, amazing story, excellent acting from the best cast of a long way, great story and great characters and costumes. Very good directing and fine character-play, the direction is great and they make some fantastic actors at their best. Amazing movie at"
"I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE","I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABEAST. The idea of making a film with such a cast of characters to make a movie about a story and the fact they are both completely different actors that would be perfect for a live TV series as a whole does not excuse this movie from being anything other than a comedy.<br /><br />As I said before though, this is not something to look forward to viewing, and even if it were, then I don't think you would notice the similarities on every level. It is one of the few movies I have in the same frame of mind. When this character is introduced to the audience, it is like seeing the character of a real person, in essence what they had to do to change their life. One aspect of this has been the way that the film works, the constant attempts to get them to speak or say something completely original or different on any given day. This is almost nothing more than the result of one character moving on to another. Sometimes you can go in and expect a boring film and then suddenly you have a new character. In fact, there is nothing to compare it to. I also feel the characters are created such that this can be viewed to be very personal, which was necessary in B-Horror films before the arrival of these characters"
"* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality ","* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality!!!!.<br /><br />If you feel cheated by the fact that both 'Gangnam Style' and 'South Park' are essentially about gangsters and revenge then you should skip both to the end of this series. In South Park we have to see both characters in an original way (see how two 'Kongsongs' can be combined? and how the two are able to walk to a high school together without being seen by everyone) and that's exactly what we came to be getting from ""Mangam"" and ""Kongdas"". If you're looking for the best gangster/heroic/funny film that was made in the 1980s and 90s then check out ""Gangs of New York City"" for a great show of pure goodness. I am looking forward to seeing this movie once it finishes running. It has great music score, and fantastic production values. The costumes are very realistic, the music is perfect, all the main characters have interesting personalities, it has beautiful sets, cool locations, fantastic sets effects (I even think it's a remake of an old TV series that aired in 1989), super cheesy special effects, superb use of a camera-capture system, authentic and accurate sound effects and an excellent soundtrack"
This is a really fun movie,This is a really fun movie. It is really enjoyable to see a movie that has not just the acting but also the direction. The film is based around three college students that are studying art to get a sense of the city and what it is like outside their apartment. This story is told in a very realistic way and really really brings life to the characters that they show. Very easy to watch. I can get the impression that the story has all the right elements to keep you entertained throughout the movie as well as to be one of my favorite kids movies.
Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues,"Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues, who claim she's nothing but a tomboy. Unfortunately, the young secretary's (Sandra Bullock) husband is also not so understanding as to have some sort of love affair with Carol the girl! The love story continues by their friendship and Carol's relationship with the beautiful Rita Hayworth (Joel Kinnaman). Both are charming and well-mannered ladies who do good work for their respective professions. The plot follows in the life of both the secretary and Rita - how both Rita and Carli are connected to each other through their careers and their friendships, and how they fall for each others' dreams, ideals, desires & values through a friendship that is always breaking up at the end. If you've read my other reviews for Rita, Rita's and Jack's book, what I enjoyed the most about this movie was the casting. Their performances combined both humor (with Carle and Mallory) and believability (Carla with Malloy) all round.<br /><br />What is a fantastic movie, it's a well made and very well acted one, perfect in every way (including the storyline). Jack the Ripper is an impressive role as Carlesi. He always does something well, especially in a comedy, but in this film he"
"When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure","When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure even by the highest ranks of Hollywood.<br /><br />The best way, as I have personally written, to compare it to the ""Lucky Ones"" ""The Haunter"" or ""Sleeping Dead"" movie is to see several different, yet totally different stories (one of the best being the brilliant screenplay of Steven Seagal). So if you enjoy a horror flick that features two ""Dwarf"" types (an all-American and an evil Japanese) and one of a few ""Zombies"" type monster types, this movie might be a good choice for you. <br/>< br />But, I still highly recommend it as a must see for fans of classics like ""Hairspray,"" ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" classics such as ""Monster Island and Monsters Inc."" (Halloween and ""Attack of The Killer Bee""); all good classics from that period.<p><p>For the love of all the gore, check this out!! It's really, really good. Not bad, considering how crappy the movies themselves are.<b />Sterling will be giving a full screening of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" on Saturday at 1pm at the Troma in Santa Monica, CA.

"Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions)","Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions) to become one of my favorite films in history, much better with better special effects (such as the fact that no actors are ever used to look like their normal versions, in fact they all look exactly the same) and a bit more music. The music is mostly composed of classical scores.<br/><p><a]The most interesting thing about this movie is that it's about a girl named Anna and her sister Sarah. Before the production was underway, and it was quite possibly the last time the two girls could sit around talking, I just noticed they were talking very much at the beginning of each movie (for instance you would hear Anna talking when her brother is talking about something else; she was talking in a very abrupt fashion) I thought I could really believe them being talking at all. This is by far an all-time classic, not only for Anna but for all of them to have talked in all their live-action films (in fact, all three of these films did so just by singing) this makes one think this isn't just a movie for these two; in other words, the three girls in the film are really the main actors.<blockquote class=""blocktext"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7"
"Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls""","Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls"" at the Brooklyn Hilton. When the queens leave their ball-bearing seats and try to dance the ball in the air, the show is interrupted by an unexpected crash landing (the first recorded video recording of this happens in 1966.) One of the dancers, Richard Branson, is being carried off to a mental institution in London where he is held in prison. The film begins with Bronson walking through a hotel room where in an earlier scene (a reference to the pilot episode ""A Prairie Home Companion"" which aired before the opening sequence), another black slave girl (played by Tia Nelton) stands in front of Brann. He shows up to apologize to her, but suddenly he reveals that he had the hots for Branny. Later on, another slave daughter takes the same steps as Brasser to show her that she could not possibly be what she was saying. There's some pretty sexual violence directed at Brasses as well, where they are sexually humiliated and then physically killed as they rape various women, including Brana. At one point, Brassassin offers them sex. Bragen plays a character with the best teeth of a man(a tribute to one of his best known actors in films) from the musical ""I Am the Walrus."""

The story is set in 1950s Britain and there are some very beautiful scenes with beautiful shots of locations taken in the hills of France and the countryside of the United Kingdom. Great music scores (the ""Stroll-on-the-Sea"" soundtrack by David Graeber is just one of many brilliant scenes).<br - 4/10"
"If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie","If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie made from the perspective of a black man or black woman, or someone from a poor background. The movie starts by a group of boys on the run from an evil boss(who is also white) and his henchmen who were caught on camera by the white cops. It also has two groups of girls and then a little boy from another group who is played brilliantly, but it also starts off with a bad girl who goes to a police academy and ends up in a jail cell where a gang of thugs get arrested after an attempted robbery. In the movie, we see the gang start out looking like the stereotypical mobsters. With the police finally apprehending the four thugs, one of whom is white, the two black thugs are arrested back in New Jersey, and we hear about the deaths of their accomplices, who are white. When white police got involved they were killed, this film is very confusing though. This movie was made in the 1980s, that year film studio The Golden Globe winners decided to make a TV series for Fox's Channel series. Since Fox didn't want to have to pay the bills to produce the series, they decided they wanted to bring the characters to life, with some variation and some humor.<br /><br />This movie is a"

It is one of the most intense and suspenseful martial art movies I have ever seen and it deserves to be remembered by any martial artist throughout the history of martial fighting. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in martial history and martial style. The ending was absolutely beautiful and the acting and directing were a masterpiece. Absolutely stunningly beautiful! I give this movie 4 stars overall!"
"""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life ","""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life!!!! If you want to watch something as bad as Father of The Pride and the Family that was the final installment of this trilogy the first season of that show will have to go. I had no idea and was waiting when it was set to air so I could buy the DVD when the pilot episode came out!<br /><br />The next morning i rented the show. Dad was right after. It was really good. The episode I was interested in watching was about this small town that I believe was in Africa where the story was told to take place in this day and age and I don`t believe that the people who were in love with him became homosexual and when he was killed for no reason but to make a baby he said ""I see he`s gay now"". It`d a really touching moment for Dad. His family were so loving to him and his friends as well as his father (when he killed his son) and he really believed his family had the right to do what they wanted with their lives. They went about their daily life as they saw fit and all of a sudden the things that happened that day were great. <br bbc.com"
i loved this movie,"i loved this movie and I will surely revisit it to see if this film was a good or bad movie.<br /><br />The first time I heard about it I could see the movie being produced. This way, I would be able to sit through a couple of scenes and catch my breath on the ""good"" reviews going out of my window before you hear about the sequels. In fact, they were dubbed for a TV movie format, in case you hadn't seen it since the early years of 1980. That way you would know that this was the same movie every time.<b]The movie was produced for DVD and was originally released for the Rental Master in the USA with the help of the US distributor. I was excited when I found that I only spent 2+ hours on DVD when they first announced this. After my parents and friends who only spoke a few lines at one point had read the DVD this did not make it right.<ref />On the surface, the film is very well developed and sets the standard for movie production on film. Yet, it is not only superbly choreographed, yet it moves at a speed rarely seen in American westerns, and is so cleverly acted that audiences just couldn't stop laughing. Even with a slow pace, this never"
"The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff","The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff with an agenda of ""revenge."" The film is clearly marketed as an action movie, which brings to mind the well-known ""Tuxedo Love."" It certainly does not try to sell your point. (I was amused at the use of the gals in the scene in this instance.) A very well known movie for cinema buffs, a classic in its day.<br /><br />I found the movie itself very appealing; I would have gone on to rent it in a heartbeat but not to take it seriously. As a director and a fan of many early action films such as ""American Psycho"" and the first movies ""The Black Panther,"" I found it enjoyable to watch as well. And for those of you who don't have the same fascination with the American tradition of action movies that I do, I encourage you to enjoy this as much as I did. It is an excellent example of a true French and Italian action game."

We take historical facts of Venezuela and what brought them over. Many events happened during the course of a single year. These events are in stark contrast to the fact that most of them are now ignored. The only difference is that the people who are supposed to be victims of these events take the lives that these individuals have been responsible for.<br /><br />The film is a perfect example of how facts are distorted in a war movie such as this documentary.

This is a masterpiece footage in B/W 35mm film,"This is a masterpiece footage in B/W 35mm film! If you are a fan of some of the classics films of that era, you too can enjoy this magnificent film. It shows the real Hollywood legend of this great film-makers of America/Germany. The story revolves around the legend and it is truly a great documentary. This film is the work by director Dario Argento and I can say that it shows some special talent and the great story of how these guys did it. He does an outstanding job in creating an extremely well executed work in 35 minute work. I cannot stand the portrayal of such wonderful actors - especially Alfred Hitchcock on many occasions. There is very little of Mr. Argentino even showing his hands. Just like Hitchcock so many times, I have come to believe that he is one of those great directors to have worked with. His film made a really great difference in making this wonderful film a unique piece of film making-especially for an American actor so bigoted. Thank you Mr Argentinos for this amazing film!!!"

"This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments","This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments. My favorite of these is the scene with the little boy. He is at the hospital that the father left on his own as part of his hospital stay. As his illness progressed he learned his place in life. The mother then leaves the room and the two of you go to the doctor's to get the necessary information about his condition and how things are going to go if he goes back. There is no plot development or any serious situations that come to mind but it is fun to watch! With all of that said, we will enjoy this episode as much as we did of ""The Sopranos"" as I have enjoyed many of Mr. Ramsey's TV series over several years at home. It is truly a pleasure to see a different series that is entertaining and entertaining the way it does. Many of what it involves has been explored in the books. I would like to show you Mr Ramsey again as ""A New Hope:"" He makes you remember the story the great William G. Widmark told to his children when he died. A good example is that it has one scene where he was eating in his bedroom and his son is watching from the bathroom mirror where the mirror had been turned off. Now I will say it: there is nothing ""different"" about this television"
Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen with a special effects film. From that moment we remember all of their stories -- fairy tale stories, dragons, demons, ghosts, a mad witch and a group of other creatures. The film also touches on all the issues of war, survival, love, redemption, forgiveness, etc., all throughout. There are many stories about these creatures in Disney's The Jungle Book or Tales of Zephyr, as well as the legendary creature Hundi, which appeared to be part of The Beast, and the creature called the Lion. When an entire town was cut off during a battle between a new and old King the beast returned as a human and transformed into an animal. Hildegarde was a true pioneer in zoology and as he saw this wonderful and wondrous bird the land was saved, he started creating more animals (including a lion) by means of his magic. By making a film this long the forest was protected from the harsh elements that are not used today by today's man (particularly forest animals etc) and created forests. Disney was one of those creators who thought for himself that the story line would bring back many of these ancient legends. To give the film a classic and well acted story this is probably the most famous film ever given to a modern film maker"
I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it,"I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it. Watching the book that day, I had to ask myself WHY the Hamström's go through the writing and interpretation, a real emotional and moral lesson for the future Hammers as they travel through life. After watching the film, the words 'Threatened' and 'Fearen' came to my mind from the Book of Hamlets and I wondered how the Godfather would react to a terrible act of brutality in the hands of a madman and to his eventual demise. I was also wondering WHY, had this great evil villain and his ""hero"" become aware of her past? Would this not make sense because of the nature of these events and as such the scene with the hero has to be seen in conjunction with her being subjected to it during her very young life? Also the way it is played, when the villain decides to take revenge on the innocent Haml's mother and daughter who were in their way to save her son, to the joy of seeing their innocence forgiven and replaced with an avenging revenge which then makes sense. In a twist that is as heart warming as it was shocking to watch in my memory. So if you need a good piece to help you understand Shakespeare, this film will help. It is simply the best Shakespeare I have in"

There's a scene where they are being interviewed about the same subject, the main question being ""What do you see""? The script is totally fake. I laughed so hard! This was THE movie I always love to watch! The only thing that I didn't enjoy was the characters or the story. The actors were so out of breath and in complete stupendous self-denial. My roommate and I both lost it. It was so bad that we only cried when the scene ended and when we realized that this was coming to an end so quickly with no time in the movie for the tears to melt away. This wasn't a bad movie, this only had one more movie and since that movie was good, it's only two reasons why I loved it sooooo much. After reading the reviews, I began to love the plot but was forced to laugh at the acting of the actors. When they said they were supposed to be good actors they absolutely couldn't have been good. That is completely incorrect. They had not gotten it right at all! When seeing this movie it reminded me of reading that review I would have laughed if I were watching a ""The Hurt Locker"" movie.

You could go a lot slower or jump a notch if you wanted. The most entertaining part of the film, of course, is the soundtrack alone. If you can find a copy of it, it'll be amazing. One of my favorites is ""You Don't Need To Be Naked"" from Michael Jackson's 1974 album, The Beatles. (You can buy it here and have this music on you from any CD player.)

It features actors such as Sir Laurence Olivier, Mark McAlpine, Dame Helen Hunt, Eileen Atkins and John Cassavetes as well as actors and actresses from other eras.<br /><br />The story is one about the struggle of a young boy in the early years of the 21st century, in one of London's poorest urban locations, under such conditions as a plague. His family is not fortunate at this young age - as the old man's brother, Alfred, goes to school, he is denied the opportunity to take up work and to go and do his father's. All a boy was born in 1861. As you can imagine Alfred was in a huge hurry to obtain work so that he could spend his full life training and learning English. Eventually this process of education leads him to the city and his parents start to suspect him as just an Englishman after his brother leaves in 1885. When he becomes a student he comes out as John the Baptist and by 1890 is the first English immigrant who can be accepted at the school. Along with this he gets a job as Professor and in his first year a little"
"I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth","I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth. The story focuses on what makes someone a good person--somehow in spite of that, not everything works out for them.<br /><br />A film where most of the actors are in trouble, while the actresses are mostly at their best, is rather dull, lacking a few interesting lines or moments in which the characters actually develop at all. But I like that the writers didn't try to try too hard to make life interesting for anybody (in fact, rather in a more positive light for most).<br - The only negative thing about this movie was that it had a lot of ""gags"", which I thought was pretty much what happened between Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd, except for one. This could have been a fun film in some ways, because it wasn't that bad and this was a much better film to spend time on just being bored--so you won't find yourself rooting for Kevin Spacey and John Lithgow in this. However, this is actually not bad in any way, so I can't give it a 4/10. It is definitely better, definitely worth a look."
"I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do","I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do. I loved the storyline of the family dealing with a tough situation and its aftermath. The characters are still there, they are always in the line of fire, making it hard for everyone to survive without them. Some scenes especially for me were about a family trying to make the transition from life without love, to what is really at stake when they must choose between their two hearts. This movie adds to the emotional roller-coaster of life through the tragedy that it caused a very young child to experience. It reminded me of how much pain I have dealt with my family of my own. Being a small family in my home area it makes me smile my heart out all the time. All the actors portray each part well, from the young actors such as Michael Ironside, who portrays the kid's father through his wife Laura. Both the wife and the kids are excellent. There is a scene when Ben's parents are at the hospital and Ben is asked about what happened to his family. Ben says that he had just received an appointment from his boss - this puts Ben in a more complicated situation as he tells his mother about his ordeal. Also, Laura tells Ben of a movie she has seen and that has taught him that not everything is good for families. He thinks that"
This is a brilliant political satire,"This is a brilliant political satire that gives political commentaries a fresh air in the modern era. It is very refreshing, entertaining and enjoyable to see a political debate being fought on a very large screen. You are more likely to hear good criticisms and more importantly come away with something that suits the subject matter.<br /><br />An example of a politically incorrect and inaccurate discussion of the war is offered by the famous ""Troublemaker"" Mr Howard Griffith. He writes the original ""War and Peace"", his later films are both full of great humourously outrageous violence, war criminals are given the most incredible powers imaginable (see, for example the killing of two soldiers in one film) and a whole lot more gore. I am no expert, but I do like it, a few different films were made on this subject, and have watched it quite often over the years with the complete understanding that this is NOT a movie aimed at the masses, although it is certainly an example for them to follow since it has absolutely nothing to do with politics or military matters. Some of Griffith's previous films include ""The Lion King"" and ""Hamlet"" which are well-made classics. If you are interested in seeing this film then you must read about Griffiths works before watching this review.<briefly,"
You play as B,"You play as Burt Reynolds in this very funny role. The film also happens to be the third, or perhaps fourth, installment of his ""I was born and raised"" (or ""You're not going to get it again. It's going through the motions!"")<br /><br />All these qualities make this a truly stunning and fun movie. There is enough emotion in the film that you will never forget the scene where you realize something is seriously wrong when you see that it is done. Also, that is one of the reasons a lot of people recommend this film. Everyone is different, because each has his own unique experience. These are very unique movies, and no one does poorly in any film when it comes to acting. This film takes you through a whole lot and is a perfect antidote to any movie that tries to overdo what is important for everyone.<br - 5/10"
This film caught me by surprise,"This film caught me by surprise. I thought ""I'll see it on DVD."" and that is exactly what I did! The acting was superb... the directing was very good, the script was good and the direction very well crafted!!! The storyline felt like you would not expect so often from an old horror film but I was stunned at how good the plot was.<br /><br />This is the story of the film by the name of ""Horror"" James Cagney. A true classic of cinema. James brought back so much atmosphere in the day and age we are so familiar with all of today, there are many great films, of course ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one such which is such a masterpiece. The story is about a young man from London who gets up in July to go to a funeral and for Christmas is with his mum the youngest of all. He meets up with a beautiful mum's dad whom leads to James taking out a huge debt on his house in order to get a part in making a movie for a bank holiday. Then James's mum leaves with the promise of seeing James ""for the first time"" and ""spend Christmas"" on her house so you know that this is ""never going to be the same again."" The film starts like this and slowly"
I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival, which was a highlight of this month's Film Society. This movie is very well made and a great viewing experience for me--it's a documentary on the movie and there are wonderful visual sequences that truly remind people of their films. I can't say enough about the production values and production design. There is, indeed, much more to this film than merely the story of an ex-Nazi, and the dialogue that I've come to know from the characters, who is a brilliant and dynamic actor. The film will take you away from your routine of seeing war films, in more depth and nuance and will make you think creatively about how this country was all before it was established as a civilized state. Every scene in the film portrays a soldier in a trench, the action of the battle, his battle and his thoughts on what life was like before the war, what was going to happen, when, from there on you'll discover what exactly the events were like and what the American Army was fighting against on a small scale, how the end will unfold and then finally what it will mean to be a successful military force on top of winning the battles, going through the difficult difficult transition from a battle to a victory, to defeating war and fighting a world war. It takes you"
THE JIST: See something else,"THE JIST: See something else? Maybe you can't get the JST-DVD to find your DVD player. This is an excellent DVD to watch by any number of the best producers. The script and editing is excellent with loads of great cinematography, excellent lighting and the film's score is superb and perfectly suited for any subject.<br /><br />The entire cast is amazing and they are absolutely wonderful. They have performed countless roles many times and are brilliant too, just like the cast for the British TV series BOBB!<br/><Briefly, the story involves a young girl called Bimbella who is the daughter of British royalty (and the nephew of Lord Byron, as well as her grandfather and great-uncle and sister and cousin of a well-known author in the west) and has long dreamed about her dream of becoming an actor in Hollywood, which she has done, to be quite serious. However, she still feels that her dreams is a long way off.<Branding herself as the'real' actress, who can portray any single part, for her role as a child star actress is fantastic and it is truly an amazing film. She and Raul are an absolute love (in my eyes)and a very dynamic couple! With such an impeccable talent"
"Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank","Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank. I'm glad that so many people could see the similarities. What I wanted to see was a very moving, touching story and I loved Natalie Portman giving the best performances and a beautiful performance in her role.<br /><br />The acting was very solid. Kate Winslet (who played Diana) played the very beautiful Anne Morgan and the chemistry between them really drew my attention. However, we were also encouraged to recognize Nicole Kidman as the most beautiful woman in the film while the love between the two characters was evident to me, that was one of the reasons we loved the movie.<divider]The film was not a good movie for me and it looked a lot like a Hollywood production and that's how I felt about the cast. It was the first film I have ever witnessed where the performance of actresses is well cast well, not just Nicole who played one character well but in great depth throughout.<p.s. For anyone interested about learning even about this wonderful film or even know anything about Kate and Anne that I haven't seen it in I gave this a 9 out of 10. In addition to hearing wonderful stories from Kate, Anne and all the actors I mentioned above, I read the book and have read thousands of reviews, this movie was quite good"
"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way. The film has the uncanny feeling of its own creation after a mysterious event, and of course the feeling is well-enjoyable in itself.<br /><br />Now we follow the tale of two two friends on a quest to find lost treasure on the brink of doom, as they search for the keys to their house--the keys being the secret of which is still unknown to them. Unfortunately for them, that key involves having an alluring encounter with some giant lizard. While trying to track down the lost key, a man breaks into the house and throws it open with a hammer! He has no idea anything of what's inside and is thus horrified by the sight of himself as the key itself suddenly falls, shattering the building down into pieces! And so the two men journey, only to encounter the evil, terrifying creature who comes through and sets them free!!! A thrilling film, thoroughly imaginative, inventive, moving, frightening, suspenseful and suspensefully well constructed, the film is definitely one that will be treasured! The original play by James Carradine was one of the best ever written and directed in modern cinema. This is probably one to remember for every movie ever made. I couldn't go back to the theater with this masterpiece, nor could I enjoy"
i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me,"i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me could remember it perfectly, and I was a little disappointed. I thought that the first half was great and the ending was just as great as the movie, but that was before I got to see it. It was enjoyable to watch. There never seemed to be a reason behind what happened to the main character and in fact there are many stories I love about how he dealt with grief and how this new world came to them. The movie has always had a passion for acting and it is easy to understand this is the director's last, the one to make a real movie. Well, I loved it, everything made perfect sense, then suddenly everything was so different when he died I could not sit still and watch this film. In its first year of production all the characters were given to different roles and many actors were changed from one actress to another. Now that I have discovered the story of Peter the Vampire I can understand why they had to change actors as well. Peter was an amazing actor who always kept us guessing. He gave us a fresh perspective on life, his life in front of the mirror and we can all say that his performance at the end of it was fantastic! I absolutely loved the way he always gave his little sister (Dennis the Werewolf) a unique look"
"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect","The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect when you listen to it on a Saturday morning. A lot of the jokes were improvised - I'll remember every time they first began, and there were quite some 'actors', like in John Wayne's ""The Man With No Name"", who were all just as talented as I am, especially the actors who I remember were in character so far. It's no wonder I loved the movie so much. The film wasn't a good movie and it was fun, that I enjoyed many of its jokes, its characters and its humor.<br /><br />I would like to hear a few positive things about it, as it has a great story, it deals with the real life story of American soldiers, which I love to reminisce about in the film and what life was like for all of them - many times when I was an avid sports fan when this movie was made. I just love watching the soldiers get ready to go to war and to have a hard time believing a word that is said and uttered in such an outrageous way. As a movie it is very funny, you get to see people doing things that were unbelievable back then."
This is what makes me proud to be British,"This is what makes me proud to be British (though British speaking is still the best I have heard). If this film is taken down, it will never be a successful title, nor a movie I love to recommend to anyone who doesn't enjoy the same genre.<br /><br />On the flip side, despite such an extensive use of music, the only reason you will see this movie for your entertainment will be by looking at the credits that shows the actors playing these scenes. As well as those, I would also love a summary of the performances: the music is all the more memorable considering that every British actor was played on two separate occasions (at the time I was filming there was an award winner at which the director had no responsibility and was on his way to winning it) and by using the movie's film-making history a tribute to a series of British talent legends.<br - from Wikipedia - 'This film was the greatest production project ever seen on screen but it was probably the most interesting and unique of them all. I also remember being the one who wanted to create the soundtrack for 'The Devil's Playground' when I first saw it on PBS in 1979 in Los Angeles. It was as if they was making The Wizard of Oz and I think this is a classic film.<blockquote="
"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today. Its story, at its heart, takes many forms: One person and his girlfriend are sent to a town where a gang of illegal immigrants has been trying to infiltrate and steal a school and the town's teachers, who have been accused of child abuse. One of them is called to stay with his mother. In the meantime, he's being stalked by a group of kids who are using the school as their home to play hide and seek. The town is attacked by the gang, but the girl has a bullet from a gun he carries.<br /><br />While this first entry was one of the most powerful Colomies (yes, we're talking about the first 15, though), it has some of these weaknesses, too: A poorly animated, weak acting and an incredibly overlong ending. It's certainly got some big names to work with, while the film's story is very poorly developed, leaving few opportunities for some serious action. There are tons of really neat special effects, which make the movie look fantastic and make it a very watchable, non-stop slog. We'll be waiting for the next film, that is, for an animated Colombo movie (thank you!) but definitely watch ""The War of Jura"", even if this is"

Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism that is not yet mainstream; this is a movie that would not be made for public consumption on TV or radio unless it had a very strong point. With only half an hour of my life left, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this one. I am now 23 and have recently done a film class at University of California, Berkeley. At the time, this was my first feature film, and I can honestly say that I thought I would be much more interested in it in the future and in modern film. While I feel the ""saturation"" is quite significant, it is also the film that gives me a great idea of the way women in our society were treated, given their social status. It's a wonderful film which shows a true side of women and how so many were manipulated and exploited here on Earth during the Cold War, yet still have such a strong connection still today. The film gives a real insight into the struggles that women would face in a society such as ours to see an open, honest community as a way to deal with issues of oppression, human greed and exploitation. All of these are very important issues today, so this film touches upon them, both in terms of our culture and the ways in which we view ourselves in film and even more"
"The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious","The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious and it showed. They were both very funny and sexy in their roles. The scene where they both talk in English is good. Another great scene was when Meg shows her car in her father's house at her first birthday birthday party. She has always wanted the family to know how she feels about her husband but she couldn't ask for their help. All the children in this film had this amazing reaction to the scene that Meg is giving the other children at the end and when that film opens it's a real treat. It seems like this whole family was born in that minute and as a result, the reaction on TV and movies in general is great. I think it shows that people are really into families and don't forget about the wonderful memories they have of that special time."
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films because of the fear of being seen out in this world. They were more than funny and entertaining enough to keep me entertained throughout! I had great problems with the costumes in the Halloween Costume Festival, the direction and the cinematography in an absolute terrible way.<br /><br />My favorite was when the monster looked as though a giant, monster-like flying horse rode down the main hall in all its inhuman size, and we only knew some of its physical characteristics later in its journey.<p.s. If you need a refresher of what is happening in Halloween, see the film's trailer.<b />"
"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even","The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even for its age or the subject matter. In this film, we are introduced to one man with a mental illness who travels to New York City to learn about his experience while investigating a suspicious death in the streets. He is not at home in all, which is why the detective, the police and paramedics are able to locate a young woman who has been lying to him in hospital but has the virus that renders him unable to see, as she has lost her touch. She has also been abducted in order to save her brother, her friends and a colleague from an attack on his former school. A couple of years later, she returns there with her husband, and begins falling in love with him. Her husband's father who is in prison is also there but there is no way for this poor little man to continue living in this world. His father's daughter tells him he could end up becoming an alcoholic, a drug addict or even the mentally ill.<br /><br />The story moves throughout that is really pretty good and the acting is pretty damn funny (I was surprised how good one part of the film plays).
