2,"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards.""The Last Battle of The Bastards"" is a beautiful film, and a great film to watch as well as a film. It shows the power of cinema to create a world where everyone can live their life with their own freedom and to live with others, not because of them, but because they have that freedom. There is something about the great people who live, there is also a bit of great medicine and an amazing story. ""The Hero in Yellow"" deals with both the human and fantasy worlds, with different people in different places and different times, all in the same way. I think this is an excellent film.""Whirling Water"" starts out very well, very very good. This is one of my very favorite movies and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to see people move around. The people are wonderful! I also loved the way they spoke and how they looked at the life of a man who is in love with his wife. A must see for anybody who loves to look at someone's life and their relationships. Jean-Georges Legrand is wonderful as the hero and by the end he is very important to the story, I really loved it!""Queen's Cry"" tells the good and of course the evil story of Jean and his people."

If you have never seen it before, then this is the film to get you on the edge of your seat, and it does it well. When you see it on your TV, watch it. Watch it if you haven't.

5,"* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality ","* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality ive always associated with the boys I grew up with,it's a great show that will give a unique angle of how girls behave,and it's also a very good show for every girl I know. The acting, the writing, and the direction are superb,perfectly crafted for a show of its genre,so if you've not heard of this show already,you will have seen it by now. If you haven't yet,then give it a go and check it out and then come back if it isn't already on IMDb,after the fact! It is one of my all time favourite shows,because it gives us an incredible story to tell the story of a beautiful girl,recovering to life after the war,while at the same time being a pretty cool girl. I love the way the characters are written and how they change in their reactions to situations,which I think is something that some of today's girls will find very intriguing. This is a perfect show to watch if not for the great acting and brilliant writing by the male leads,as I'm sure many of you know by today,this series is very unique to it,its a wonderful show,however you might think,the characters will carry you through their times,imagine"

7,Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues,"Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues (Jean-Marc Valland, Max Von Sydow, Guy Ritchie) and is forced to work for a living. Unfortunately, she is able to overcome the obstacles thrown at her through her courage and will fight to the end for freedom. During the war, Carli was a hero to many, and her fight against Nazism inspired the American resistance to Hitler. In her new role, the film shows the courage the two men faced and how they fought together. This film is a powerful film, as well as an inspiring one to watch. It is very good to see that people of all ages can understand a lot of great things. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to relate to Carlette and to those of us with a history of resistance. If you are a Van Damme fan or a follower of Van Dien, go there and see this one. You will be impressed. The music is amazing. Carchi is the perfect actress to play the part of the hero in the movie. She is brilliant as Carrigan and VanDien. One of my favorite actresses by far. Her movie is one perfect movie to show to any, anyone, that resistance is based on. Although I disliked the book, I have enjoyed every chapter and every scene and"
8,"When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure","When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure. It has been praised for the heart-warming story and the outstanding acting. That is what makes this movie different from other romantic thrillers I have seen. I enjoyed it immensely and it is one of the best films I've ever seen.<br /><br />I think the film is an outstanding work of art and a powerful musical. This film gives us a great musical score and is a must for all lovers of great music. The music is perfect and I loved the ending.<Br />I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in great film music, or great dancing. Its also a perfect movie for film fans. There is also plenty of music to the movie, great performances by the great actors and great actresses.<br -><BR />This is probably the most powerful movie I ever saw.

9,"Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions)","Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions) and it gives the same great performance (as in the original) as well as the way in which it is shot (although it was a good, I think, original script that I highly recommend). This version is very well done and I found it very enjoyable to watch. I also found that this is an excellent film to see, as it shows a lot of the greats of both countries in their roles, especially in both the 1940s and the early thirties (before the Blitz). As I said earlier, the film shows very much where the two countries were in 1940 and how the war affected them. Here, it's also very good. It's a great film for all ages to try to understand what made the world great, and what it would mean to a person of that era.<br/>< br />This is a very nice film as a film, because it captures and portrays the incredible beauty of life in each country (the other countries had much different countries, more of them than I expected). And it also shows how it works at the level of a 'la rue de l'Art' (a place of family, friendship, beauty) so that it can work perfectly with the different cultures in a way that most other people would have"

This is a movie that should be loved. It is perfect. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in martial art. If you are a fan of martial artists then you'll be very very impressed by this film. The acting by the actors is brilliant. All of the characters are likable and I am sure a lot of people have seen the movie because of it's awesome special effects. In fact I loved their scenes together, although some of them seem slightly different, so it is not a film for everyone. However it does a great job with the action it creates with great skill and great timing.

18,"This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela","This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. Part documentary and part documentary, I found this a great documentary. The way the events were written allows us to understand the role of family and the relationships that existed between the brothers, as well as the situation of each family, their relationship to each other, how they were supported by each others, and also how some things contributed to change within each of those families. This movie was a real treat to my heart because it's a film about family life. It also demonstrates the relationship between a wealthy individual and a poor individual. I loved this movie because I think it shows one of two things (or no fact) about the people of Venezuela: the families that I and others refer to in this book. For instance, there are some families in Venezuela that are also rich and powerful, that were very different from the way they are today. So, for example, an older brother, who is a well-educated, well loved man, goes to college, starts a career, pays a lot of money, buys a car, lives in a pretty home, has two beautiful children, makes friends, owns a good business, is successful, etc. In this whole movie, the brother and brother are very much similar, but in my opinion, this is the essence of how"

You will find yourself laughing at each character, at their interactions with each other, and at the amazing story they have created. If you haven't seen this, it will definitely make you laugh! I also think that this movie is great for the people who love to create movies, because it gives a great movie for them to follow, to write, or even just to see. And for those people that have not noticed that I am from Europe, I usually enjoy this film because I found it to be perfect for me. For those who don't know, the characterizations are perfect; they look great in this picture and for someone who is not completely blind, you will love this perfect picture for certain people. Also, watch the movie without the glasses, as it has great special effects and stunning acting. A must, especially for people of all ages, if you think about it"
