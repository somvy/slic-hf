1,"If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl","If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl! The book is great as well, as is the book itself! As I said, it is very well written, with lots of good effects. It has many beautiful scenes of the forest, birds, horses, houses, trees, buildings, mountains, etc., I think. the author is also very talented, though I'm not a huge fan of his works. He has worked in many movies, I've seen a lot, mostly of different directors, directors of other films and TV series, he obviously enjoyed his work very much. Some reviewers have called him ""The Most Famous Actor of All Time"", I disagree, however, in all these cases he's one of my favorites, even when I have seen him before in other works, most probably his best work! I loved this film, well I was surprised to find it on DVD!! It gets into many characters, lots. I also liked its setting, which is wonderful, especially for a movie, because I usually enjoy a good locale! Overall, one thing I would recommend is, keep this movie on the DVD or watch it now."
2,"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards","If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards, its telling as he travels from village to village in a series of seemingly random pictures. He will discover in these new pictures that what he's been forced to understand is not reality, but what is reality. This film, made for television in 1959. The book is the best-selling piece of graphic filmography ever made and Jean-Philippe Rochon, in his book, is excellent here in doing the necessary filming for his work as a photographer. Ruchon's images in both films contain subtle, beautiful images that give the audience the impression that everything is happening right under their noses. Most of Ruhr's movies, especially the books, are great for creating realistic images for audiences. A powerful film for adults that is also amazing for children."
3,Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made,"Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made, and I think it is still one to watch. It is an amazing and unique film that will be loved by everyone who loves it. A great film, a must see, must learn, MUST recommend, AND I highly recommend it to everyone I know. If anyone can recommend this great movie to anyone who has never seen it before, you are going to be on the right track and won't be disappointed."
4,"I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE","I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABEAR (1968). This film is brilliant indeed, and also highly enjoyable to watch. It is still an excellent film for any time and many people use it in their daily lives."
5,"* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality ","* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality!!! Secondly, despite the fact that you are very much young at this point in my life, it really makes it very well worth watching this time! It doesn't take yourself too seriously as it does and it's really worth seeing as well! The acting and story aren't so bad as to be worth listening to and i've seen a lot of good movies in it and this is a must watch for everybody! i have also seen some of John Wayne's other films, also, and as an adult myself, the movie itself is definitely worth paying attention to. It goes a long way and makes something out of nothing to make it an enjoyable movie! I must recommend it! the special effects were amazing and is great, as is The Shining, which i love and really enjoy! This was a totally great movie, one to watch and definitely one of my favorites of all time.<br /><br />I just highly recommend this movie to anyone who like to hear stories of teenagers or of teens who love horror movies, or to people with teens, to see this great show, that is, an amazing show!"

7,Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues,"Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues who can and will force him to see 'the world and see the light'. Together, they are able to rescue a couple from a mental ward. But after the murder of their mother, Carli begins to discover that she's no murderer at all and she never kills the young criminals. With a love story between two men like this, viewers will appreciate the brilliance of Carle and her style of work, and the strength of characters throughout. All of it is brilliantly handled and beautifully acted. I highly recommend it to all."
8,"When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure","When this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure, and was one of the greatest films of all time.<br /><br />I bought it for $3.99 with purchase of this DVD and watched it again in 2007.<b><b=1]Despite great acting, great camera work, terrific music, fantastic sequences and excellent special effects (and excellent costumes), this movie is still a must see for all of us!"
9,"Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions)","Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions) and the two are very similar and it's not hard to see why. It should also be noted that much of the story has been lost in modern day Germany (for a lot of us we now live in very different places with no access to video and few movies), it seems, and probably is, a lost medium and is a great film to look at. I highly recommend it."
10,"Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls""","Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold ""balls"" to compete at the top, taking in the women of America's capital and beating them on a regular basis. These drag parodies of those stereotypes are now popular among young black people. This documentary shows that black men are not, as a whole, the victims of ""race prejudice"" and it shows these characteristics in both the real life and the stereotypes portrayed by the men as young men. <br /><br />The filmmakers also illustrate how some of the jokes about how ""women get the upper hand"" in drag are still funny today. That is why I loved the film and I still think it is worth a watch. It is a film that makes me laugh and to know that some women still get to try on their looks, I really liked it and enjoyed it.<br * from ****"
11,I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals,"I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals, but to me it's an incredibly effective one. I'll keep watching this movie to it will it gives you a good feeling about what it all means.<br /><br />I just bought it from Walmart and loved it. It is amazing and worth the time it takes to sit through."
12,"If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie","If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie made since. It's the best movie written and directed by an amazing talent! All the characters are unforgettable and it's always interesting to read about them on TV. I loved it, and am hooked by it everyday! It makes you watch movies with laughter, passion, surprise and love, right out of a movie, just to get up with each new concept of the film. This is a great film that keeps you going every time it is in your room! I'm hooked on seeing it all the times I watch it!"
13,"You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life","You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life, and maybe even the entire world. I have watched this movie three times, this time it was one of my best years of TV watching, so I enjoyed it immensely! I also loved the acting. You won't find a better cast in today's world! It's my favorite series, since A Voice For Men! This is a great series for anyone. It is very realistic, the writing is believable, I do not think there is anyone in history who can act as well! The acting for me was outstanding. There have only been four episodes with this film, but I think it is probably the best series ever. The story is well told, especially for the first two seasons of this series. This show is not just for kids. Kids who are going to college are not that likely to get involved, if they are really into this show. So, without further ado, let's start! My favorite thing is when a character dies. When a person dies, they don't even want to talk about what happened to them. In fact, there are very good things about this new series! Every episode I watch for this one show, it makes me want something on TV! When something happens, things will happen to people in a very interesting way, very fast"
14,"After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth","After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth that the action sequences in it are incredibly well done, both visually and cinematically. I have seen this movie several times recently, my only major criticism of the movie remains the fact that it is not a very fast paced movie (I can see this being one of my strengths), although much of what the story is about is very good and it shows. The characters of this film are beautifully cast, the atmosphere is truly fantastic, and the direction is fantastic in this superb action/adventure. One of mine that I often mentioned in reviews is the role of Cang Lee Yeon, a ruthless and handsome businessman who has become one hell of a money man after falling in love with his brother Jia. Cog is one heck of an actor, especially for a character of his size. He plays a tough man who is perfectly perfect in every detail and everything. There is no way you can stop watching this because it's absolutely stunning. In fact, as you might imagine, every single scene is brilliant by the brilliant Cag, who makes his mark in his own right and he plays superbly. Amazingly, this is, arguably, one one very cool martial art movie, just as it was originally produced, so I will continue to rave about this amazing movie at"
15,"""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life ","""Father of the Pride "" was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life. I still remember it well at the time. It was my favorite show and one of my best ever. The whole gang and crew live a life of adventure and mystery and all the little details of this show is just incredible. They love everyone, and even each other. And the more stories are told the better! They are real people now, more people can learn, the bigger this world grows. This is a great show, amazing! And I loved it so much to watch with friends I fell in love with. Everyone is amazing, a little weird, some very cool, you can count on me to tell you one way or another from each episode. Amazing! If you are a fan of great shows, this is probably the show for you. As long as you love great movies, I highly recommend this one."
16,i loved this movie,"i loved this movie! I rented it recently from a friend, and it was a great movie. I have the DVD and I love the story!"
17,"The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff","The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff than it was back in the late 70's (and still today) and has had it's share of successful sequels as well. A wonderful tale about men who live forever without hope and the beauty of love. The story itself is well worth the time, and is a great look at the early beginnings of the modern world. This is an extremely well written screenplay and also a wonderful film. I highly recommend this film to anybody who truly loves movies."
18,"This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela","This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. I personally liked the movie immensely from beginning to end. It is well-written, well researched, it has a beautiful story and the dialogue is powerful. The director is very well known for movies like The Matrix and The Mummy, both of which I always loved, so it is highly recommended to everyone. What we are left with is a film that is truly breathtaking and in excellent working order."

20,This is one of the best Bollywood movies i have seen up until now,"This is one of the best Bollywood movies i have seen up until now. I loved it. The actors were great and very beautiful. It is easy to see why Bhamshen is such an award-winning Indian film. Its amazing to have a film about Hindu culture so well loved by so many. And when its time to marry Hinduism to Islam, its just a good time. <br /><br />It can't be beat any Indian movie. (I have to say, this is very good.) I love the wonderful music from all the great musicians and their music. Even the B-list actors in every profession, including acting, do a great job! As for the movie: it's not a cheap movie, but one worthy of seeing."
21,"This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments","This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments of our own. It's a fun, fun show to watch, and I'll be keeping an eye out for a future episode!"
22,Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen which are now all here and made me a huge fan of them. I was blown away by this show. The stories were incredibly engaging and the photography is very unique and stunning. And the music is fantastic too. It is superb! It was a great movie, the way the script was written also makes perfect sense and it is amazing to see such a fine piece of work. Definitely a must see."
23,I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it,"I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it with an interest that transcends the mundane everyday. Well, this movie is different and is an excellent comedy and a great movie, that I will go watch again and again. I must say I enjoyed it tremendously. The special effects are fantastic, the acting is incredible, characters are believable and I am so happy to have seen it. Watching it today, it reminds me of the first time I watched Shakespeare, when I was three years old. It is fantastic."
24,"When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987)","When I found this film in my local videostore I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire film in the same vein of ""The Lost Boys""(1987) and I have to stress that what I heard was not quite accurate. Unfortunately for me the film is very unique and it still stands up here in a wonderful way. If the original vampire films are one of the best that I've ever seen, then the movie's unique charm will stand up very well with most of our modern people. ""I Can't Breathe"" is a good movie to watch because its its not the only one and its worth seeing to see if you haven't already."
25,"I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban","I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban, but it is a good movie.<br /><br />I enjoy this movie because it's very simple, very well thought out, extremely detailed, it reminds me strongly to not always focus on the black characters in the movie, because when it comes to women, black people and white people, they look like separate things (much like an ordinary person's). This movie is quite good.<Br />It helps me to write off all my previous comments and criticisms of this film, if in my opinion I am mistaken I would say that the story of the protagonist is accurate for everyone. It's a well known historical truth. The movie gives us much more than a simplistic view, this is also a very important, deeply complex, historical fact. In my way it provides us a lot more complex feelings than just a simple one!<br -><-br --<->< br />My comment about this IMDB list is really a really smart, well-thought-out, interesting and informative review of it. If the average USer has a big clue on what is going on in this great movie (or if he has never seen it before, as yet) or movie I strongly recommend to him, then I really recommend this to everyone!"

27,(spoilers??)<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to think of the movie,"(spoilers??)<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to think of the movie. How could I? It's pretty good and a must see, to watch and in it's original state. I also liked it so I might as well use it as my ""must-see"" for the holidays.<br p />It is great to see the great actors in the genre, not only from their actors I have never seen in my life and who I look up to, but also from all the people working in film now.< br / >I highly recommend viewing this movie!"

29,To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made,"To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made I've ever shot and I'm very proud to say that it's an incredible collection of films that tell a very telling story about a young man who goes insane and goes on a rampage for a year and a half. It's true that the film-making is very good- it is a wonderful watch- I particularly enjoy a film like this that is so great you cannot stop watching it, but that alone can't stop me from making this masterpiece! I also love the cast- the fantastic actors, the amazing actors in great situations, and the great script! This is my favorite movie I ever enjoyed, I can honestly say it was a winner every night I was in it. I even have my own account of it and watch it to this day now of course I still love it as well! There is some great actors on this movie and in quite a few of my favourite movies I have ever seen!!! I enjoyed this film so much it gave me hope a lot! Overall a great movie, worth every time you see it! For any family to have a chance, this is absolutely perfect. This movie deserves to get more than 5 stars from me! It is one of those wonderful movies everyone should see!"
30,"I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth","I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth and not that well acted. While I like the story, the scenes in which it's told are often rather moving but give it something a very real feel. The film manages to capture the feeling of loneliness which is most prevalent in New Orleans at the time of the Civil War. It also contains many important scenes of this time period which I found quite entertaining. This film is still quite good and if you're looking for something to see and have a laugh, this is an excellent film."
31,"I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do","I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do still is, so I've seen many great movies from the late 60's from around the world, with a great deal of enjoyment. I highly recommend this film to anyone."
32,This is a brilliant political satire,"This is a brilliant political satire on a personal story.<br /><br />I had seen the film at the Cannes Film Festival last week and absolutely loved it. I enjoyed the drama, comedy and drama in it as much as anyone else. It is one I will continue to watch to this day."
33,You play as B,"You play as Bisham Ali. This is a tough movie for me. I have been watching it for weeks and I couldn't stop watching. The movie was well written, very touching and full of a strong feeling in my life. After watching the film I am very glad that I went ahead and watched it because I really think it is worth the money. It is definitely a must see for any family."
34,This film caught me by surprise,"This film caught me by surprise. The story is very touching and is about forgiveness as the young man struggles with depression, the role of God vs. selfishness, and our relationship to each other. It made me realize that there is also a very real gulf between humanity and the world in which we live. There are a lot of people out there who don't understand what forgiveness in itself really is or even have the skills of empathy in order to change lives. This film allows us to see, to understand, both how we see God, how the love we share is not simply the one we have, but the way we approach life, through our relationships with others, with each of us, for the good of others and those around us. I don`t know how I can fully praise the film for that, honestly, because it contains a great deal to say, I mean by this I am a Christian in a way and a writer, that I think is one of the best things about God in my book."
35,I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival,"I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival, and after watching it several times I knew it was a great movie. A great film and not as bad as it might seem at first, this is a superb movie and a fantastic blend of comedy and action. I loved it."
36,THE JIST: See something else,"THE JIST: See something else that shows a similar side to this movie. It contains great visuals, great performances, and much more. Plus a great soundtrack and great music by some of the best composer in the world."
37,"Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank","Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank. She is always ready at all times to give any job her client, even in a business of theirs, offers her, I think, of a life, but she wants to be with him the way she did with her old boyfriend.<br /><br />On top of all that it is a wonderful movie with extraordinary performances and very strong emotional resonance. You never notice the difference, however, between the two characters. There are moments of dramatic tension, moments in which people look at each other, and of course a very real sense of unease. This is the most well made movie I've seen in years and it also captures the real emotions very well. The film is also very interesting to watch because it's very moving and I found the whole film very fascinating. (The movie has an excellent soundtrack) This wonderful film was also an instant must-have. It's also one of my favourites. I'm glad I got it."
38,"Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way","Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way as that he directed, he succeeds in bringing it to life. He also creates a perfect villain, and I couldn't stop watching him. The film is wonderful in several areas, from the beautiful scenery to the gorgeous shadows to it all. This fantastic film also brings to mind the wonderful music and soundtrack of King, who also made one masterpiece movie, the film itself, with the amazing score by Peter Gabriel. Of course I have enjoyed many King movies before, including The King and His Brotherskine, but this is one of them, it's one that I still enjoy. Although the movie is an amazing film, Kubrick creates one to be in, that you should watch, you do. I highly recommend it, to anyone that will listen to King without the constraints of watching some of his classic movies."
39,i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me,i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me said well it was a great comedy because I hate that genre of films and I do enjoy how it got out of the box. It's an excellent movie indeed and to me that proves this is my favourite movie of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch comedy and mystery films or people interested in the history of cinema.
40,"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect","The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect. There really isn't much that I liked about this film, besides that there is some really beautiful scenes which are pretty cool.<br /><br />There are some great scenes in the movie (you might want to look around if it is raining). There are also some very really cool and exciting scenes (the whole film is very well shot) and a big scene with a bunch of women (well, in this case all women anyway) in a bar. Also, the scene about getting a haircut is amazingly sexy because it goes against the style of traditional hairstyles. In other words it was awesome.<b /= RAN*><breed*"
41,This is what makes me proud to be British,"This is what makes me proud to be British, you can watch it in an incredibly beautiful setting. Everything about it is great!"
42,"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today","This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today, especially as the series continues to evolve. When the first entry was released in 1983, the show and the ""crony"" was an important concept and was highly acclaimed. Colomines were often seen in many television films and a number of classic Colombo stories are still viewed by many today. This is a great Colo of the 60's by today's standards, with wonderful music, well-acted characters and fantastic characters. The Colombians are a wonderful people, to say the least and are no strangers to great storytelling. I loved the Colos, a good person loved to tell stories and I had many memories of being one of them! This show is truly timeless and as much as I hated it, I enjoyed more the great special effects and all the scenes that depict the fantastic Colino. It is great to see this TV show again and again, that still comes to life now that it is here."
43,"Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love","Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love, and people living in cities, towns, temples or cities all around us, it is well documented that a love of adventure and war made for great entertainment. We can see this in movie, movie and TV, as well as novels, novels of any kind, poetry, music, dance, drama and many other fine works. The story of this wonderful writer is great, this film is fantastic, the film itself is stunning, and we will do all that the best, I am sure many people would agree. That's where it shines in many movies. This is a great movie that is truly unique, especially among movie lovers, because you see great performances, perfect lines, great music and I do believe many of you will enjoy this fantastic masterpiece. I will guarantee you the highest rating of your favorite movie! I recommend this movie to everyone! It is the story, not the characters, however, so much of the book is brilliant, in fact quite amazing, that makes this special one of my favorite books of ALL time! This movie is in my top 5 favorite movies! Very very well made, very amazing and great. Definitely one to choose with anyone! What I would like to say, for anyone who loves books more and especially for those of us with an interest"
44,Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism,"Post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism, you really get a sense of their humanity. <br /><br />It is very well done, as is the film by its star, and is an interesting look at a culture whose many problems have left them with an innate hatred for each other. It is not the most well acted movie I have seen in about a decade, but it's something special, especially for someone who is still growing up. I loved it."
45,"The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious","The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious. And the moment she is introduced at a bar she has a great moment of sexual attraction towards everyone and it's amazing how a relationship can be so complex. At no point does she want the guy to have sex with her but, she loves him but it gets to go downhill quickly. I highly recommend this film to any friend, if you don't have any good sexual tension you can watch it with them, you'll laugh, and you might even kiss."
46,I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films,"I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films where they sometimes look at 'what the legend tells' and sometimes take a step back and look inside our minds, and how it really works in the stories and lives of the characters. As I have said before the first time I watched this film I was hooked on it. I didn't really know what to expect, yet it made me feel for the film, for my family, my friends, myself, I loved it, it is a great film and it will always be one of my all time favorite films."

The Running Mother and The Scent of Love are different films... but it is still a funny film..... It is also an excellent film also... I would watch it again... it's a really very good film..."
